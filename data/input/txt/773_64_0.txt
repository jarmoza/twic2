Through lane it lay - thro' bramble -
Through clearing and thro' wood -
Banditti often passed us
Opon the lonely road.
The wolf came peering curious -
The Owl looked puzzled down -
The serpent's satin figure
Glid stealthily along,
The tempests touched our garments -
The lightning's poinards gleamed -
Fierce from the Crag above us
The hungry Vulture screamed -
The Satyrs fingers beckoned -
The Valley murmured "Come" -
These were the mates -
This was the road
These Children fluttered home.

One Blessing had I than the rest
So larger to my Eyes
That I stopped guaging - satisfied -
For this enchanted size -
It was the limit of my Dream -
The focus of my Prayer -
A perfect - paralyzing Bliss -
Contented as Despair -
I knew no more of Want - or Cold -
Phantasms both become
For this new Value in the Soul -
Supremest Earthly Sum -
The Heaven below the Heaven above -
Obscured with ruddier Blue -
Life's Latitudes leant over - full -
The Judgment perished - too -
Why Bliss so scantily  disburse -
Why Paradise defer -
Why Floods be served to Us - in Bowls -
I speculate no more -

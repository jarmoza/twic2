Only a Shrine, but Mine -
I made the Taper shine -
Madonna dim, to whom all Feet may come,
Regard a Nun -
Thou knowest every Wo -
Needless to tell thee - so -
But can'st thou do
The Grace next to it - heal?
That looks a harder skill to us -
Still - just as easy, if it be thy Will
To thee - Grant Me -
Thou knowest, though, so Why tell thee?

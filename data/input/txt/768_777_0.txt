It knew no Medicine -
It was not Sickness - then -
Nor any need of Surgery -
And therefore - 'twas not Pain -
It moved away the Cheeks -
A Dimple at a time -
And left the Profile - plainer -
And in the place of Bloom
It left the little Tint
That never had a Name -
You've seen it on a Cast's face -
Was Paradise - to blame -
If momently ajar -
Temerity - drew near -
And sickened - ever afterward
For Somewhat that it saw?

A still - Volcano - Life -
That flickered in the night -
When it was dark enough to do
Without erasing sight -
A quiet - Earthquake style -
Too subtle to suspect
By natures this side Naples -
The North cannot detect
The solemn - Torrid - Symbol -
The lips that never lie -
Whose hissing Corals part - and shut -
And Cities - ooze away -

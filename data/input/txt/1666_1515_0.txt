Tell as a Marksman - were forgotten
Tell - this Day endures
Ruddy as that Coeval Apple
The Tradition bears -
Fresh as Mankind that humble story
Though a statelier Tale
Grown in the Repetition hoary
Scarcely would prevail -
Tell had a son - The ones that knew it
Need not linger here -
Those who did not to Human nature
Will subscribe a Tear -
Tell would not bare his Head
In Presence
Of the Ducal Hat -
Threatened for that with Death - by Gessler -
Tyranny bethought
Make of his only Boy a Target
That surpasses Death -
Stolid to Love's  supreme entreaty
Not forsook of Faith -
Mercy of the Almighty  begging -
Tell his Arrow sent -
God it is said replies in Person
When the Cry is meant

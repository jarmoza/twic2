Color - Caste - Denomination -
These - are Time's Affair -
Death's diviner Classifying
Does not know they are -
As in sleep - all Hue forgotten -
Tenets - put behind -
Death's large - Democratic fingers
Rub away the Brand -
If Circassian - He is careless -
If He put away
Chrysalis of Blonde - or Umber -
Equal Butterfly -
They emerge from His Obscuring -
What Death - knows so well -
Our minuter intuitions -
Deem unplausible

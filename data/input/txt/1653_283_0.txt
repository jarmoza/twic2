"Morning" - means "Milking"
To the Farmer -
Dawn - to the Appenine -
Dice - to the Maid.
"Morning" means - just - Chance
To the Lover -
Just - Revelation -
To the Beloved -
Epicures - date a Breakfast, by it!
Heroes - a Battle -
The Miller - A Flood -
Faintgoing Eyes - their  lapse - from sighing -
Faith - the Experiment
Of our Lord!

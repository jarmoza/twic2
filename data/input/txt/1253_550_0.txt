It dont sound so terrible - quite - as it did -
I run it over - "Dead", Brain - "Dead".
Put it in Latin - left of my school -
Seems it dont shriek so - under rule.
Turn it, a little - full in the face
A Trouble looks bitterest -
Shift it - just -
Say "When Tomorrow comes this way -
I shall have waded down one Day".
I suppose it will interrupt me some
Till I get accustomed - but then the Tomb
Like other new Things - shows largest - then -
And smaller, by Habit -
It's shrewder then
Put the Thought in advance - a Year -
How like "a fit" - then -
Murder - wear!

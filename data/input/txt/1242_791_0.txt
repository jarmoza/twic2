I'm saying every day
"If I should be a Queen, Tomorrow" -
I'd do this way -
And so I deck, a little ,
If it be, I wake a Bourbon,
None on me - bend supercilious -
With "This was she -
Begged in the Market place - Yesterday."
Court is a stately place -
I've heard men say -
So I loop my apron - against the Majesty
With bright Pins of Buttercup -
That not too plain -
Rank - overtake me -
And perch my Tongue
On Twigs of singing - rather high -
But this, might be my brief Term
To qualify -
Put from my simple speech all plain word -
Take other accents, as such I heard
Though but for the Cricket - just,
And but for the Bee -
Not in all the Meadow -
One accost me -
Better to be ready -
Than did next Morn
Meet me in Arragon -
My old Gown - on -
And the surprised Air
Rustics - wear -
Summoned - unexpectedly -
To Exeter -

He told a homely tale
And spotted it with tears -
Opon his infant face was set
The Cicatrice of years -
All crumpled was the cheek
No other kiss had known
Than flake of snow, divided with
The Redbreast of the Barn  -
If Mother - in the Grave -
Or Father - on the Sea -
Or Father in the Firmament -
Or Bretheren, had he -
If Commonwealth below,
Or Commonwealth above
Have missed a Barefoot Citizen -
I've ransomed it -alive -

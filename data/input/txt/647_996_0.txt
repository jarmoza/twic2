God gave a Loaf to every Bird -
But just a Crumb - to Me -
I dare not eat it - tho' I starve -
My poignant luxury -
To own it - touch it -
Prove the feat - that made the Pellet mine -
Too happy - for my Sparrow's chance -
For Ampler Coveting -
It might be Famine - all around -
I could not miss an Ear -
Such Plenty smiles opon my Board -
My Garner shows so fair -
I wonder how the Rich - may feel -
An Indiaman - An Earl -
I deem that I - with but a Crumb -
Am Sovreign of them all -

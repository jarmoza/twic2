I meant to find Her when I Came -
Death - had the same design -
But the Success - was His - it seems -
And the Surrender - Mine -
I meant to tell Her how I longed
For just this single time -
But Death had told Her so the first -
And she had past, with Him -
To wander - now - is my Repose -
To rest - To rest would be
A privilege of Hurricane
To Memory - and Me -

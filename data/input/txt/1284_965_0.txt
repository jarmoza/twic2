Their Hight in Heaven comforts not -
Their Glory - nought to me -
'Twas best imperfect - as it was -
I'm finite - I cant see -
The House of Supposition -
The Glimmering Frontier that
skirts the Acres of Perhaps -
To me - shows insecure -
The Wealth I had - contented me -
If 'twas a meaner size -
Then I had counted it until
It pleased my narrow Eyes -
Better than larger values -
That show however true -
This timid life of Evidence
Keeps pleading - "I dont know" -

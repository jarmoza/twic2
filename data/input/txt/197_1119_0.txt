'Tis Sunrise - little Maid - Hast Thou
No Station in the Day?
'Twas not thy wont, to hinder so -
Retrieve thine industry -
'Tis Noon - My little Maid -
Alas - and art thou sleeping yet?
The Lily - waiting to be Wed -
The Bee - Hast thou forgot?
My little Maid - 'Tis Night - Alas
That Night should be to thee
Instead of Morning - Had'st thou broached
Thy little Plan to Die -
Dissuade thee, if I c'd not, Sweet,
I might have aided - thee -

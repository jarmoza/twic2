Heart not so heavy as mine
Wending late home
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune -
A careless snatch - a ballad
A ditty of the street.
Yet to my irritated ear
An Anodyne so sweet
It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled, and paused ,
Then bubbled slow away.
It was as if a chirping brook
Opon the dusty way,
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why.
Tomorrow night will come again
Perhaps weary, and sore -
Ah Bugle! by my window
I pray you pass once more -

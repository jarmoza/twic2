Shall I take thee, the Poet said
To the propounded word?
Be stationed with the Candidates
Till I have finer tried -
The Poet searched Philology
And was about to ring
for the suspended Candidate
There came unsummoned in -
That portion of the Vision
The Word applied to fill
Not unto nomination
The Cherubim reveal -

I cautious, scanned my little life -
I winnowed what would fade
From what w'd last till Heads like mine
Should be a'dreaming laid.
I put the latter in a Barn -
The former, blew away.
I went one winter morning
And lo, my priceless Hay
Was not opon the "Scaffold" -
Was not opon the "Beam" -
And from a thriving Farmer -
A Cynic, I became.
Whether a Thief did it -
Whether it was the wind -
Whether Deity's guiltless -
My business is, to find!
So I begin to ransack!
How is it Hearts, with Thee?
Art thou within the little Barn
Love provided Thee?

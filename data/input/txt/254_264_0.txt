To learn the transport thro' the pain -
As Blind men learn the sun -
To die of thirst, suspecting
That Brooks in meadows run -
To stay the homesick - homesick feet
Opon a foreign shore -
Haunted by native lands - the while -
And blue - beloved Air -
This is the sovreign anguish -
This - the signal wo -
These are the patient "Laureates" -
Whose stanza, hushed, below -
Breaks in victorious Carol -
Inaudible - indeed -
To us - the duller Cornets
Of the mysterious "Band" -

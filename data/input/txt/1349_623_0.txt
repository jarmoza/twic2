I see thee better in the dark,
I do not need a light,
The love of thee a prism be
Excelling violet.
I see thee better for the years
That hunch themselves between,
The miner's lamp sufficient be
To nullify the mine.
And in the grave I see thee best -
It's little panels be
A'glow, all ruddy with the light
I held so high for thee!
What need of day to those whose dark
Hath so surpassing sun,
It deem it be continually
At the meridian?

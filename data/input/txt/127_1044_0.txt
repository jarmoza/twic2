Growth of Man - like Growth of Nature -
Gravitates within -
Atmosphere, and Sun endorse it -
But it stir - alone -
Each - it's difficult Ideal
Must achieve - Itself -
Through the solitary prowess
Of a Silent Life -
Effort - is the sole condition -
Patience of Itself -
Patience of opposing forces -
And intact Belief -
Looking on - is the Department
Of it's Audience -
But Transaction - is assisted
By no Countenance -

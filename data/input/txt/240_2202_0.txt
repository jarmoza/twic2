No Brigadier throughout the Year
So civic as the Jay -
A Neighbor and a Warrior too
With shrill felicity
Subduing Winds that  censure us
A January Day -
The Brother of the Universe
Was never blown away -
The Snow and he are intimate -
I've often seen them play
When Heaven looked upon us all
With such severity
I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky
Whose pompous frown was Nutriment
To their temerity -
The Pillow of this daring Head
Is pungent Evergreens -
His Larder - terse and Militant
Unknown - refreshing things -
His character - a Tonic -
His Future a Dispute -
Unfair an Immortality
That leaves this  Neighbor out -

Precious to Me - She still shall be -
Though She forget the name I bear -
The fashion of the Gown I wear -
The very Color of My Hair -
So like the Meadows - now -
I dared to show a Tress of Their's
If haply - She might not despise
A Buttercup's Array -
I know the Whole - obscures the Part -
The fraction - that appeased the Heart
Till Number's Empery -
Remembered - as the Milliner's flower
When Summer's Everlasting Dower -
Confronts the dazzled Bee -

We Cover Thee - Sweet Face -
Not that We tire of Thee -
But that Thyself fatigue of Us -
Remember - as Thou go -
We follow Thee until
Thou notice Us - no more -
And then - reluctant - turn away
To Con Thee o'er and o'er -
And blame the scanty love
We were Content to show -
Augmented - Sweet - a Hundred fold -
If Thou would'st take it - now -

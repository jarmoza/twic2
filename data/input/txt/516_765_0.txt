A Visitor in Marl -
Who influences Flowers -
Till they are orderly as Busts -
And Elegant - as Glass -
Who visits in the Night -
And just before the Sun -
Concludes his glistening interview -
Caresses - and is gone -
But whom his fingers touched -
And where his feet have run -
And whatsoever Mouth he kissed -
Is as it had not been -

As Summer into Autumn slips
And yet we sooner say
The Summer than the Autumn - lest
We turn the Sun away
And count it almost an Affront
A Presence to concede
Of one however lovely - not
The one that we have loved
So we evade the Charge of Years
On one attempting shy
The Circumvention of the  Thought
Of Life's Declivity -

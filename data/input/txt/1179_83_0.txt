Could live - did live -
Could die - did die -
Could smile opon the whole
Through faith in one he met not -
To introduce his soul -
Could go from scene familiar
To an untraversed spot -
Could contemplate the journey
With unpuzzled heart -
Such trust had one among us -
Among us not today -
We who saw the launching
Never sailed the Bay!

Promise This - When You be Dying -
Some shall summon Me -
Mine belong Your latest Sighing -
Mine - to Belt Your Eye -
Not with Coins - though they be Minted
From An Emperor's Hand -
Be my lips - the only Buckle
Your low Eyes - demand -
Mine to stay - when all have wandered -
To devise once more
If the Life be too surrendered -
Life of Mine - restore -
Poured like this - My Whole Libation -
Just that You should see
Bliss of Death - Life's Bliss extol thro'
Imitating You -
Mine - to guard Your Narrow Precinct -
To seduce the Sun
Longest on Your South, to linger,
Largest Dews of Morn
To demand, in Your low favor -
Lest the Jealous Grass
Greener lean - Or fonder cluster
Round some other face -
Mine to supplicate Madonna -
If Madonna be
Could behold so far a Creature -
Christ - omitted - Me -
Just to follow Your dear feature -
Ne'er so far behind -
For My Heaven -
Had I not been
Most enough - denied?

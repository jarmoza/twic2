A Shady friend - for Torrid days -
Is easier to find -
Than one of higher temperature
For Frigid - hour of mind -
The Vane a little to the East -
Scares Muslin souls - away -
If Broadcloth Hearts are firmer
Than those of Organdy -
Who is to blame? The Weaver?
Ah, the bewildering thread!
The Tapestries of Paradise
So notelessly - are made!

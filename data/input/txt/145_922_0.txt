Sweet - safe - Houses -
Glad - gay - Houses -
Sealed so stately tight -
Lids of Steel - on Lids of Marble -
Locking Barefeet out -
Brooks of Plush - in Banks of Satin
Not so softly fall
As the laughter - and the whisper -
From their People Pearl -
No Bald Death - affront their Parlors -
No Bold Sickness come
To deface their stately Treasures -
Anguish - and the Tomb -
Hum by - in muffled Coaches -
Lest they - wonder Why -
Any - for the Press of Smiling -
Interrupt - to die -

As far from pity, as complaint -
As cool to speech - as stone -
As numb to Revelation
As if my Trade were Bone -
As far from Time - as History -
As near yourself - Today -
As Children, to the Rainbow's scarf -
Or Sunset's Yellow play
To eyelids in the Sepulchre -
How dumb the Dancer lies -
While Color's Revelations break -
And blaze - the Butterflies!

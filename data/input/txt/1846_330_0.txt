An awful Tempest mashed the air -
The clouds were gaunt, and few -
A Black - as of a spectre's cloak
Hid Heaven and Earth from view -
The creatures chuckled on the Roofs -
And whistled in the air -
And shook their fists -
And gnashed their teeth -
And swung their frenzied hair -
The morning lit - the Birds arose -
The Monster's faded eyes
Turned slowly to his native coast -
And peace - was Paradise!

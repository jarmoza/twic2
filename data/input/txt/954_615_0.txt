I never felt at home below,
And in the handsome skies
I shall not feel at home I know
I dont like Paradise!
For there 'tis Sunday all the time
And recess never comes,
And Eden'll be so lonesome
Bright Wednesday afternoons!
If God could make a journey,
Or ever took a nap,
So not to see us
But they say Himself a telescope
Perennial beholds us.
Myself would run away
From Him and Holy Ghost and all,
Butthere's the Judgment Day!

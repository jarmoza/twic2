Were nature mortal lady
Who had so little time
To pack her trunk and order
The great exchange of clime
How rapid, how momentous
What exigencies were
But nature will be ready
And have an hour to spare.
To make some trifle fairer
That was too fair before
Enchanting by remaining,
And by departure more.

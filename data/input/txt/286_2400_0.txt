The Look of thee, what is it like
Hast thou a hand or Foot
Or mansion of Identity
And what is thy Pursuit
Thy fellows are they realms or Themes
Hast thou Delight or Fear
Or Longing - and is that for us
Or values more severe -
Let change transfuse all other Traits
Enact all other Blame
But deign this least certificate
That thou shalt be the same -

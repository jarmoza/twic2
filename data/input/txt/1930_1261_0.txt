I cannot buy it - 'tis not sold -
There is no other in the World -
Mine was the only one
I was so happy I forgot
To shut the Door And it went out
And I am all alone -
If I could find it Anywhere
I would not mind the journey there
Though it took all my store
But just to look it in the Eye -
"Did'st thou"? "Thou did'st not mean", to say,
Then, turn my Face away.

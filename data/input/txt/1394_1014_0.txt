The Sunrise runs for Both -
The East - Her Purple Troth
Keeps with the Hill -
The Noon unwinds Her Blue
Till One Breadth cover Two -
Remotest - still -
Nor does the Night forget
A Lamp for Each - to set -
Wicks wide away -
The North - Her blazing Sign
Erects in Iodine -
Till Both - can see -
The Midnight's Dusky Arms
Clasp Hemispheres, and Homes
And so
Opon Her Bosom - One -
And One opon Her Hem -
Both lie -

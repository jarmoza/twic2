A Single Clover Plank
Was all that saved a Bee
A Bee I personally knew
From sinking in the sky -
Twixt Firmament above
And Firmament below
The Billows of Circumference
Were sweeping him away -
The idly swaying Plank
Responsible to nought
A sudden Freight of Wind assumed
And Bumble Bee was not -
This harrowing event
Transpiring in the Grass
Did not so much as wring from him
A wandering "Alas" -

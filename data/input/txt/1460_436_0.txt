Savior! I've no one else to tell -
And so I trouble thee.
I am the one forgot thee so -
Dost thou remember me?
Nor, for myself, I came so far -
That were the little load -
I brought thee the imperial Heart
I had not strength to hold -
The Heart I carried in my own -
Till mine too heavy grew -
Yet - strangest - heavier since it went -
Is it too large for  you?

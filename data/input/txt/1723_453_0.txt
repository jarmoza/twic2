"Heaven" - is what I cannot reach!
The Apple on the Tree -
Provided it do hopeless - hang -
That - "Heaven" is - to Me!
The Color, on the cruising cloud -
The interdicted Land -
Behind the Hill - the House behind -
There - Paradise - is found!
Her teazing Purples - Afternoons -
The credulous - decoy -
Enamored - of the Conjuror -
That spurned us - Yesterday!

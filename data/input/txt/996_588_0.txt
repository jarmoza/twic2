The Months have ends - the Years - a knot -
No Power can untie
To stretch a little further
A Skein of Misery -
The Earth lays back these tired lives
In her mysterious Drawers -
Too tenderly, that any doubt
An ultimate Repose -
The manner of the Children -
Who weary of the Day -
Themself - the noisy Plaything
They cannot put away -

My Worthiness is all my Doubt -
His Merit - all my fear -
Contrasting which, my quality
Do lowlier - appear -
Lest I should insufficient prove
For His beloved Need -
The Chiefest Apprehension
Opon my thronging Mind -
'Tis true - that Deity to stoop
Inherently incline -
For nothing higher than Itself
Itself can rest opon -
So I - the Undivine Abode
Of His Elect Content -
Conform my Soul - as 'twere a Church,
Unto Her Sacrament -

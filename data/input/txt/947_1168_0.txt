Deprived of other Banquet ,
I entertained Myself -
At first - a scant nutrition -
An insufficient Loaf -
But grown by slender addings
To so esteemed a size
'Tis sumptuous enough for me -
And almost to suffice
A Robin's famine - able -
Red Pilgrim, He and I -
A Berry from our table
Reserve - for Charity -

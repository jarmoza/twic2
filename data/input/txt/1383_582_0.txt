How sick - to wait - in any place - but thine -
I knew last night - when some one tried to twine -
Thinking - perhaps - that I looked tired - or alone -
Or breaking - almost - with unspoken pain -
And I turned - ducal -
That right - was thine -
One port - suffices - for a Brig like mine -
Our's be the tossing - wild though the sea -
Rather than a mooring - unshared by thee.
Our's be the Cargo - unladen - here -
Rather than the "spicy isles -"
And thou - not there -

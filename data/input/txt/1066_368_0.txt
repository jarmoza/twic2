If He dissolve - then - there is nothing - more -
Eclipse - at Midnight -
It was dark - before -
Sunset - at Easter -
Blindness - on the Dawn -
Faint Star of Bethleem -
Gone down!
Would but some God - inform Him -
Or it be too late!
Say - that the pulse just lisps -
The Chariots wait -
Say - that a little life - for  His -
Is leaking - red -
His little Spaniel - tell Him!
Will He heed?

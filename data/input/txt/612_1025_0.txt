Conscious am I in my Chamber -
Of a shapeless friend -
He doth not attest by Posture -
Nor confirm - by Word -
Neither Place - need I present Him -
Fitter Courtesy
Hospitable intuition
Of His Company -
Presence - is His furthest license -
Neither He to Me
Nor Myself to Him - by Accent -
Forfeit Probity -
Weariness of Him, were quainter
Than Monotony
Knew a Particle - of Space's
Vast Society -
Neither if He visit Other -
Do He dwell - or Nay - know I -
But Instinct esteem Him
Immortality -

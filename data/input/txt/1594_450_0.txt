A solemn thing - it was - I said -
A Woman - white - to be -
And wear - if God should count me fit -
Her blameless mystery -
A timid thing - to drop a life
Into the mystic well -
Too plummetless - that it  come back -
Eternity - until -
I pondered how the bliss would look -
And would it feel as big -
When I could take it in my hand -
As hovering - seen - through fog -
And then - the size of this "small" life -
The Sages - call it small -
Swelled - like Horizons - in my  breast -
And I sneered - softly - "small"!

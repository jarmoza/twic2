Her - "last Poems"!
Poets - ended -
Silver - perished - with her Tongue -
Not on Record - bubbled other -

Gushed too free for the Adoring -

On the Head too High to Crown -

Be it's Grave - sufficient Sign -
Nought - that We - No Poet's Kinsman -
Suffocate - with easy wo -
What, and if, Ourself a Bridegroom -
Put Her down - in Italy?

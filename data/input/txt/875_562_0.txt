The face I carry with me - last -
When I go out of Time -
To take my Rank - by - in the West -
That face - will just be thine -
I'll hand it to the Angel -
That - Sir - was my Degree -
In Kingdoms - you have heard the Raised -
Refer to - possibly.
He'll take it - scan it - step aside -
Return - with such a crown
As Gabriel - never capered at -
And beg me put it on -
And then - he'll turn me round and round -
To an admiring sky -
As One that bore her Master's name -
Sufficient Royalty!

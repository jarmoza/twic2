"Arcturus" is his other name.
I'd rather call him "Star."
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!
I slew a worm the other day.
A "Savan" passing by
Murmured "Resurgam" - "Centipede"!
"Oh Lord, how frail are we"!
I pull a flower from the woods -
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath -
And has her in a "class"!
Whereas I took the Butterfly -
Aforetime in my hat -
He sits erect in "Cabinets" -
The Clover bells forgot.
What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now -
Where I proposed to go
When time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.
What if the poles sh'd frisk about
And stand opon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst" -
Whatever prank betides!
Perhaps the "kingdom of Heaven's" changed.
I hope the "Children" there
Wont be "new fashioned" when I come -
And laugh at me - and stare -
I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl -
Old fashioned - naughty - everything -
Over the stile of "Pearl."

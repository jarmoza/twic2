I could die - to know -
'Tis a trifling knowledge -
News-Boys salute the Door -
Carts - joggle by -
Morning's bold face - stares in the window -
Were but mine - the Charter of the least Fly -
Houses hunch the House
With their Brick shoulders -
Coals - from a Rolling Load - rattle - how - near -
To the very Square - His foot is passing -
Possibly, this moment -
While I - dream - Here -

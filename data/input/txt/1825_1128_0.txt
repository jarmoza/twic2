Struck, was I, nor yet by Lightning -
Lightning - lets away
Power to perceive His Process
With Vitality -
Maimed - was I - yet not by Venture -
Stone of Stolid Boy -
Nor a Sportsman's Peradventure -
Who mine Enemy?
Robbed - was I - intact to Bandit -
All my Mansion torn -
Sun - withdrawn to Recognition -
Furthest shining - done -
Yet was not the foe - of any -
Not the smallest Bird
In the nearest Orchard  dwelling -
Be of Me - afraid -
Most - I love the Cause that slew Me -
Often as I die
It's beloved Recognition
Holds a Sun on Me -
Best - at Setting - as is Nature's -
Neither witnessed Rise
Till the infinite Aurora
In the Other's Eyes -

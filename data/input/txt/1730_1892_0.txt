Those Cattle smaller than a Bee
That herd opon the Eye -
Whose tillage is the passing Crumb -
Those Cattle are the Fly -
Of Barns for Winter -  blameless -
Extemporaneous stalls
They found to our  objection -
On Eligible Walls -
Reserving the presumption
To suddenly descend
And gallop on the Furniture -
Or odiouser offend -
Of their peculiar calling
Unqualified to judge
To Nature we remand them
To justify or scourge -

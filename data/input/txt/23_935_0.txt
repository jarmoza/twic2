Why make it doubt - it hurts it so -
So sick - to guess -
So strong - to know -
So brave - opon it's little Bed
To tell the very last They said
Unto Itself - and smile - And shake -
For that dear - distant - dangerous - sake -
But - the Instead - the Pinching fear
That Something - it did do - or dare -
Offend the Vision - and it flee -
And They no more remember me -
Nor ever turn to tell me why -
Oh, Master, This is Misery -

The Judge is like the Owl -
I've heard my Father tell -
And Owls do build in Oaks -
So here's an Amber Sill -
That slanted in my Path -
When going to the Barn -
And if it serve You for a House -
Itself is not in vain -
About the price - 'tis small -
I only ask a Tune
At Midnight - Let the Owl select
His favorite Refrain.

I cannot live with You -
It would be Life -
And Life is over there -
Behind the Shelf
The Sexton keeps the key to -
Putting up
Our Life - His Porcelain -
Like a Cup -
Discarded of the Housewife -
Quaint - or Broke -
A newer Sevres pleases -
Old Ones crack -
I could not die - with You -
For One must wait
To shut the Other's Gaze down -
You - could not -
And I - Could I stand by
And see You - freeze -
Without my Right of Frost -
Death's privilege?
Nor could I rise - with You -
Because Your Face
Would put out Jesus' -
That New Grace
Glow plain - and foreign
On my homesick eye -
Except that You than He
Shone closer by -
They'd judge Us - How -
For You - served Heaven - You know,
Or sought to -
I could not -
Because You saturated sight -
And I had no more eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise
And were You lost, I would be -
Though my name
Rang loudest
On the Heavenly fame -
And were You - saved -
And I - condemned to be
Where You were not
That self - were Hell to me -
So we must meet apart -
You there - I - here -
With just the Door ajar
That Oceans are - and Prayer -
And that White Sustenance -
Despair -

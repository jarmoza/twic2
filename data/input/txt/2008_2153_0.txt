The Things that never can come back, are several -
Childhood - some forms of Hope - the Dead -
But Joys like men may sometimes make a Journey
And still abide -
We do not mourn for Traveler or Sailor -
Their Routes are fair -
But think - enlarged - of all that they will tell us -
Returning here -
"Here"! There are typic Heres -
Foretold Locations -
The Spirit does not stand -
Himself - at whatsoever Fathom
His Native Land -

I hav'nt told my garden yet -
Lest that should conquer me.
I hav'nt quite the strength now
To break it to the Bee -
I will not name it in the street
For shops w'd stare at me -
That one so shy - so ignorant
Should have the face to die.
The hillsides must not know it -
Where I have rambled so -
Nor tell the loving forests
The day that I shall go -
Nor lisp it at the table -
Nor heedless by the way
Hint that within the Riddle
One will walk today -

She lay as if at play
Her life had leaped away -
Intending to return -
But not so soon -
Her merry Arms, half dropt -
As if for lull of sport -
An instant had forgot
The Trick to start -
Her dancing Eyes - ajar -
As if their Owner were
Still sparkling through
For fun - at you -
Her Morning at the door -
Devising, I am sure -
To force her sleep -
So light - so deep -

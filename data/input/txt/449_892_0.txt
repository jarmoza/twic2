He parts Himself - like Leaves -
And then - He closes up -
Then stands opon the Bonnet
Of Any Buttercup -
And then He runs against
And oversets a Rose -
And then does Nothing -
Then away opon a Jib - He goes -
And dangles like a Mote
Suspended in the Noon -
Uncertain - to return Below -
Or settle in the Moon -
What come of Him at Night -
The privilege to say
Be limited by Ignorance -
What come of Him - That Day -
The Frost - possess the World -
In Cabinets - be shown -
A Sepulchre of quaintest Floss -
An Abbey - a Cocoon -

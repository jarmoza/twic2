I often passed the Village
When going home from school -
And wondered what they did there -
And why it was so still -
I did not know the year then,
In which my call would come -
Earlier, by the Dial,
Than the rest have gone.
It's stiller than the sundown.
It's cooler than the dawn -
The Daisies dare to come here -
And birds can flutter down -
So when you are tired -
Or - perplexed - or cold -
Trust the loving promise
Underneath the mould,
Cry "it's I," "take Dollie,"
And I will enfold!  "Dollie" (line 17) was a pet name for Susan Dickinson, to whom

The Crickets sang
And set the Sun
And Workmen finished, one by one
Their Seam the Day opon.
The low Grass loaded with the Dew,
The Twilight stood as Strangers do -
With Hat in Hand, polite and new
To stay as if, or go.
A Vastness, as a Neighbor, came -
A Wisdom without Face or Name -
A Peace, as Hemispheres at Home -
And so, the Night became -

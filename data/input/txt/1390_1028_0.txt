Drama's Vitallest Expression is the Common Day
That arise and set about Us -
Other Tragedy
Perish in the Recitation -
This - the best enact
When the Audience is scattered
And the Boxes shut -
"Hamlet" to Himself were Hamlet -
Had not Shakespeare wrote -
Though the "Romeo" left no Record
Of his Juliet,
It were infinite enacted
In the Human Heart -
Only Theatre recorded
Owner cannot shut -

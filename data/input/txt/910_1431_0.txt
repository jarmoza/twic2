I've dropped my Brain - My Soul is numb -
The Veins that used to run
Stop palsied - 'tis Paralysis
Done perfecter in stone -
Vitality is Carved and cool -
My nerve in marble lies -
A Breathing Woman
Yesterday - endowed with Paradise.
Not dumb - I had a sort that moved -
A Sense that smote and stirred -
Instincts for Dance - a caper part -
An Aptitude for Bird -
Who wrought Carrara in me
And chiselled all my tune
Were it a witchcraft - were it Death -
I've still a chance to strain
To Being, somewhere - Motion - Breath -
Though Centuries beyond,
And every limit a Decade -
I'll shiver, satisfied.

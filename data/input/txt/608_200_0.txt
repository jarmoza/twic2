Just lost, when I was saved!
Just felt the world go by!
Just girt me for the onset with Eternity,
When breath blew back,
And on the other side
I heard recede the disappointed tide!
Therefore, as One returned, I feel,
Odd secrets of the line to tell!
Some Sailor, skirting foreign shores -
Some pale Reporter, from the awful doors
Before the Seal!
Next time, to stay!
Next time, the things to see
By ear unheard -
Unscrutinized by eye -
Next time, to tarry,
While the Ages steal -
Slow tramp the Centuries,
And the Cycles wheel!

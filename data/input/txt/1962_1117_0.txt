The Admirations - and Contempts - of time -
Show justest - through an Open Tomb -
The Dying - as it were a Hight
Reorganizes Estimate
And what We saw not
We distinguish clear -
And mostly - see not
What We saw before -
'Tis Compound Vision -
Light - enabling Light -
The Finite - furnished
With the Infinite -
Convex - and Concave Witness -
Back - toward Time -
And forward -
Toward the God of Him -

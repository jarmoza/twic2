Who never lost, is unprepared
A Coronet - to find.
Who never thirsted,
Flagons, and cooling Tamarind.
Who never climbed the weary league -
Can such a foot explore
The purple Territories
On Pizarro's shore?
How many legions overcome -
The Emperor will say?
How many Colors taken
On Revolution Day?
How many Bullets bearest?
Angels! Mark "promoted"
On this soldier's brow!

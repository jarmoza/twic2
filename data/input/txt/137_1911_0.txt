The Bat is dun, with wrinkled Wings -
Like fallow Article -
And not a song pervade his Lips -
Or none perceptible.
His small Umbrella quaintly halved
Describing in the Air
An Arc alike inscrutable
Elate Philosopher.
Deputed from what Firmament -
Of what Astute Abode -
Empowered with what malignity
Auspiciously withheld -
To his adroit Creator
Ascribe no less the praise -
Beneficent, believe me,
His eccentricities -

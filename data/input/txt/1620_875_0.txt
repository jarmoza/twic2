I gained it so -
By Climbing slow -
By catching at the Twigs that grow
Between the Bliss - and me -
It hung so high
As well the Sky
Attempt by Strategy -
I said I gained it -
This - was all -
Look, how I clutch it
Lest it fall -
And I a Pauper go -
Unfitted by an instant's Grace
For the Contented - Beggar's face
I wore - an hour ago -

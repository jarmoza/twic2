I'll tell you how the Sun rose -
A Ribbon at a time!
The Steeples swam in Amethyst!
The news like squirrels ran!
The hills untied their Bonnets!
The Bobolinks begun!
Then I said softly to myself
"That must have been the sun"!
But how he set, I know not!
There seemed a purple stile
Which little yellow boys and girls
Were Climbing all the while -
Till when they reached the other side,
A Dominie in gray
Put gently up the evening bars
And led the flock away!

The Skies cant keep their secret!
They tell it to the Hills -
The Hills just tell the Orchards -
And they - the Daffodils!
A Bird - by chance - that goes that way -
Soft overhears the whole -
If I should bribe the little Bird -
Who knows but she would tell?
I think I wont - however -
It's finer - not to know -
If Summer were an axiom -
What sorcery had snow?
So keep your secret - Father!
I would not - if I could -
Know what the Sapphire Fellows, do,
In your new-fashioned world!

Her smile was shaped like other smiles -
The Dimples ran along -
And still it hurt you, as some Bird
Did hoist herself, to sing,
Then recollect a Ball, she got -
And hold opon the Twig, -
Convulsive, while the Music crashed -
Like Beads - among the Bog -
A happy lip - breaks sudden -
It does'nt state you how
It contemplated - smiling -
Just consummated - now -
But this one, wears it's merriment
So patient - like a pain -
Fresh gilded - to elude the eyes
Unqualified, to scan -

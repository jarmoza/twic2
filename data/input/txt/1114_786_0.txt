The Day came slow - till Five o'clock -
Then sprang before the Hills
Like Hindered Rubies - or the light
A Sudden Musket - spills -
The Purple could not keep the East -
The Sunrise shook abroad
Like Breadths of Topaz - packed a Night -
The Lady just unrolled -
The Happy Winds - their Timbrels took -
The Birds - in docile Rows
Arranged themselves around their Prince -
The Wind - is Prince of Those -
The Orchard sparkled like a Jew -
How mighty 'twas to be
A Guest - in this stupendous place -
The Parlor - of the Day!

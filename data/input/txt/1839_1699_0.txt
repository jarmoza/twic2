I cannot see my soul, but know 'tis there -
Nor ever saw his house, nor furniture -
Who has invited me with him to dwell;
But a confiding guest, consult as well,
What raiment honor him the most,
That I be adequately dressed -
For he insures to none
Lest men specifical adorn -
Procuring him perpetual drest
By dating it a sudden feast.

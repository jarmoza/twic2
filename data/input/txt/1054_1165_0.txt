What I see not, I better see -
Through Faith - My Hazel Eye
Has periods of shutting -
But, No lid has Memory -
For frequent, all my sense obscured
I equally behold
As some one held a light  unto
The Features so beloved -
And I arise - and in my Dream -
Do Thee distinguished Grace -
Till jealous Daylight interrupt -
And mar thy perfectness -

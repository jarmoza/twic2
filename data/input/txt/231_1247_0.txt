As imperceptibly as Grief
The Summer lapsed away -
Too imperceptible at last
To feel like Perfidy -
A Quietness distilled -
As Twilight long begun -
Or Nature - spending with Herself
Sequestered Afternoon -
Sobriety inhered
Though gaudy influence
The Maple lent unto the Road
And graphic Consequence
Invested sombre place -
As suddenly be worn
By sober Individual
A Homogeneous Gown -
Departed was the Bird -
And scarcely had the Hill
A flower to help His straightened face
In stress of Burial -
The Winds came closer up -
The Cricket spoke so clear
Presumption was - His Ancestors
Inherited the Floor -
The Dusk drew earlier in -
The Morning foreign shone -
The courteous - but harrowing Grace
Of Guest who would be gone -
And thus, without a Wing
Or Service of a Keel -
Our Summer made Her light Escape
Unto the Beautiful -

I live with Him - I see His face -
I go no more away
For Visitor - or Sundown -
Death's single privacy
The Only One - forestalling Mine -
And that - by Right that He
Presents a Claim invisible -
No Wedlock - granted Me -
I live with Him - I hear His Voice -
I stand alive - Today -
To witness to the Certainty
Of Immortality -
Taught Me - by Time - the lower Way -
Conviction - every day -
That Life like This - is stopless -
Be Judgment - what it may -

I'll clutch - and clutch -
Next - One - Might be the golden touch -
Could take it -
Diamonds - Wait -
I'm diving - just a little late -
But stars - go slow - for night -
I'll string you - in fine necklace -
Tiaras - make - of some -
Wear you on Hem -
Loop up a Countess - with you -
Make - a Diadem - and mend my old One -
Count - Hoard - then lose -
And doubt that you are mine -
To have the joy of feeling it - again -
I'll show you at the Court -
Bear you - for Ornament
Where Women breathe -
That every sigh - may lift you
Just as high - as I -
And - when I die -
In meek array - display you -
Still to show - how rich I go -
Lest Skies impeach a wealth so wonderful -
And banish me -

Just so - Jesus - raps -
He - does'nt weary -
Last - at the Knocker -
And first - at the Bell.
Then - on divinest tiptoe - standing -
Might He but spy the lady's soul -
When He - retires -
Chilled - or weary -
It will be ample time for - me -
Patient - opon the steps -  until then -
Heart! I am knocking - low at thee.

That odd old man is dead a year -
We miss his stated Hat -
'Twas such an evening bright and stiff
His faded lamp went out -
Who miss his antiquated Wick -
Are any hoar for him?
Waits any indurated mate
His wrinkled coming Home?
Oh Life, begun in fluent Blood
And consummated dull -
Achievement, contemplating  thee -
Feels transitive and cool.

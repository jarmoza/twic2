Unto like Story - Trouble has enticed me -
How Kinsmen fell -
Brothers and Sisters - who preferred the Glory -
And their young will
Bent to the Scaffold, or in Dungeons - chanted -
Till God's full time -
When they let go the ignominy - smiling -
And Shame went still -
Unto guessed Crests, my moaning fancy, leads me,
Worn fair
By Heads rejected - in the lower country -
Of honors there -
Such spirit makes her perpetual mention,
That I - grown bold -
Step martial - at my Crucifixion -
As Trumpets - rolled -
Feet, small as mine - have marched in Revolution
Firm to the Drum -
Hands - not so stout - hoisted them - in witness -
When Speech went numb -
Let me not shame their sublime deportments -
Drilled bright -
Beckoning - Etruscan invitation -
Toward Light -

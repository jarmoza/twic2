After all Birds have been investigated
And laid aside
Nature imparts the little Blue Bird -
Assured
Her conscientious voice
Will soar unmoved
Above ostensible vicissitude -
First at the March
Competing with the Wind -
Her zealous Note
Delights it to ascend -
Last at the Scene
When Summer swerves away -
Fortitude - flanked with Melody.

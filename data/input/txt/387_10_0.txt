Adrift! A little boat adrift!
And night is coming down!
Will no one guide a little boat
Unto the nearest town?
So sailors say - on yesterday -
Just as the dusk was brown
One little boat gave up it's strife
And gurgled down and down.
So angels say - on yesterday -
Just as the dawn was red
One little boat - o'erspent with gales -
Retrimmed it's masts - redecked it's sails -
And shot - exultant on!

One dignity delays for all -
One mitred afternoon -
None can avoid this purple -
None evade this crown!
Coach, it insures, and footmen -
Chamber, and state, and throng -
Bells, also, in the village
As we ride grand along!
What dignified attendants!
What service when we pause!
How loyally at parting
Their hundred hats they raise!
How pomp surpassing ermine
When simple You, and I,
Present our meek escutscheon
And claim the rank to die!

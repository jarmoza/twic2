I read my sentence - steadily -
Reviewed it with my eyes,
To see that I made no mistake
In it's extremest clause -
The Date, and manner, of the shame -
And then the Pious Form
That "God have mercy" on the Soul
The Jury voted Him -
I made my soul familiar - with her extremity -
That at the last, it should not be a novel Agony -
But she, and Death, acquainted -
Meet tranquilly, as friends -
Salute, and pass, without a Hint -
And there, the Matter Ends -

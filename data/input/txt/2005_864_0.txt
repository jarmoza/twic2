Me prove it now - Whoever doubt
Me stop to prove it - now -
Make haste - the Scruple! Death be scant
For Opportunity -
The River reaches to my feet -
As yet - My Heart be dry -
Oh Lover - Life could not convince -
Might Death - enable Thee -
The River reaches to My Breast -
Still - still - My Hands above
Proclaim with their remaining might -
Dost recognize the Love?
The River reaches to my Mouth -
Remember - when the Sea
Swept by my searching eyes - the last -
Themselves were quick - with Thee!

All overgrown by cunning moss,
All interspersed with weed,
The little cage of "Currer Bell"
In quiet "Haworth" laid.
Gathered from many wanderings -
Gethsemane can tell
Thro' what transporting anguish
She reached the Asphodel!
Soft fall the sounds of Eden
Opon her puzzled ear -
Oh what an afternoon for  Heaven,
When "Bronte" entered there!

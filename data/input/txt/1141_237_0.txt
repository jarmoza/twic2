I have a King, who does not speak -
So - wondering - thro' the hours meek
I trudge the day away -
Half glad when it is night - and sleep -
If, haply, thro' a dream, to peep
In parlors, shut by day.
And if I do - when morning comes -
It is as if a hundred drums
Did round my pillow roll,
And shouts fill all my childish sky,
And Bells keep saying 'Victory'
From steeples in my soul!
And if I dont - the little Bird
Within the Orchard, is not heard,
And I omit to pray
'Father, thy will be done' today
For my will goes the other way,
And it were perjury!

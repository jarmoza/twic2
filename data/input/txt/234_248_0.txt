Dust is the only secret -
Death - the only one
You cannot find out all about
In his native town -
Nobody knew his Father -
Never was a Boy -
Had'nt any playmates
Nor "Early history" -
Industrious - Laconic -
Punctual - sedate -
Bolder than a Brigand -
Swifter than a Fleet -
Builds like a Bird - too -
Christ robs the nest -
Robin after Robin
Smuggled to rest -

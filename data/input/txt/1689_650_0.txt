A Solemn thing within the Soul
To feel itself get ripe -
And golden hang - while farther up -
The Maker's Ladders stop -
And in the Orchard far below -
You hear a Being - drop -
A wonderful - to feel the sun
Still toiling at the cheek
You thought was finished -
Cool of eye, and critical of Work -
He shifts the stem - a little -
To give your Core - a look -
But solemnest - to know
Your chance in Harvest moves
A little nearer - Every sun
The single - to some lives.

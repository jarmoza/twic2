This is a Blossom of the Brain -
A small - italic Seed
Lodged by Design or Happening
The Spirit fructified -
Shy as the Wind of his Chambers
Swift as a Freshet's Tongue
So of the Flower of the Soul
It's process is unknown -
When it is found, a few rejoice
The Wise convey it Home
Carefully cherishing the spot
If other Flower become -
When it is lost, that Day shall be
The Funeral of God,
Opon his Breast, a closing Soul
The Flower of Our Lord -

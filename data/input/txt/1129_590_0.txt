Your - Riches - taught me - poverty!
Myself, a "Millionaire"
In little - wealths - as Girls can boast -
Till broad as "Buenos Ayre" -
You drifted your Dominions -
A Different - Peru -
And I esteemed - all - poverty -
For Life's Estate - with you!
Of "Mines" - I little know - myself -
But just the names - of Gems -
The Colors - of the Commonest -
And scarce of Diadems -
So much - that did I meet the Queen -
Her glory - I should know -
But this - must be a different wealth -
To miss it - beggars - so!
I'm sure 'tis "India" - all day -
To those who look on you -
Without a stint - without a blame -
Might I - but be the Jew!
I know it is "Golconda" -
Beyond my power to dream -
To have a smile - for mine - each day -
How better - than a Gem!
At least - it solaces - to know -
That there exists - a Gold -
Altho' I prove it, just in time -
It's distance - to behold!
It's far - far - Treasure - to surmise -
And estimate - the Pearl -
That slipped - my simple fingers - thro'
While yet - a Girl - at school!

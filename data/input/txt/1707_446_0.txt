The maddest dream - recedes - unrealized -
The Heaven we chase -
Like the June Bee - before the Schoolboy -
Invites the Race -
Stoops to an Easy Clover -
Dips - Evades -
Teazes - deploys -
Then - to the Royal Clouds -
Spreads his light pinnace -
Heedless of the Boy -
Staring - defrauded - at the
Mocking sky -
Homesick for steadfast Honey -
Ah, the Bee
Flies not - that brews
That rare variety!

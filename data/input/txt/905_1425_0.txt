Sang from the Heart, Sire,
Dipped my Beak in it,
If the Tune drip too much
Have a tint too Red
Pardon the Cochineal -
Suffer the Vermillion -
Death is the Wealth
Of the Poorest Bird.
Bear with the Ballad -
Awkward - faltering -
Death twists the strings -
'Twas'nt my blame -
Pause in your Liturgies -
Wait your Chorals -
While I repeat your
Hallowed Name -

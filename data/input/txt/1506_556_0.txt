Do People moulder equally,
They bury, in the Grave?
I do believe a species
As positively live
As I, who testify it
Deny that I - am dead -
And fill my Lungs, for Witness -
From Tanks - above my Head -
I say to you, said Jesus,
That there be standing here -
A sort, that shall not taste of Death -
If Jesus was sincere -
I need no further Argue -
The statement of the Lord
Is not a controvertible -
He told me, Death was dead -

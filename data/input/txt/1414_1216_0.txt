Because the Bee may blameless hum
For Thee a Bee do I become
List even unto Me -
Because the Flowers unafraid
May lift a look on thine, a Maid
Alway a Flower would be -
Nor Robins, Robins need not hide
When Thou opon their Crypts intrude
So Wings bestow on Me
Or Petals, or a Dower of Buzz
That Bee to ride - or Flower of Furze
I that way worship Thee -

Crisis is a Hair
Toward which forces creep
Past which - forces retrogade
If it come in sleep
To suspend the Breath
Is the most we can
Ignorant is it Life or Death
Nicely balancing -
Let an instant push
Or an Atom press
Or a Circle hesitate
In Circumference
It may jolt the Hand
That adjusts the Hair
That secures Eternity
From presenting - Here -

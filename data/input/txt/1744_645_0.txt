Of Being is a Bird
The likest to the Down
An Easy Breeze do put afloat
The General Heavens - opon -
It soars - and shifts - and whirls -
And measures with the Clouds
In easy - even - dazzling pace -
No different the Birds -
Except a Wake of Music
Accompany their feet -
As did the Down emit a Tune -
For Extasy - of it

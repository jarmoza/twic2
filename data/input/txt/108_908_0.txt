One Crucifixion is recorded - only -
How many be
Is not affirmed of Mathematics -
Or History -
One Calvary - exhibited to stranger -
As many be
As Persons - or Peninsulas -
Gethsemane -
Is but a Province - in the Being's Centre -
Judea -
For Journey - or Crusade's Achieving -
Too near -
Our Lord - indeed - made Compound Witness -
And yet -
There's newer - nearer Crucifixion
Than That -

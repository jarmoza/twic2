We learned the Whole of Love -
The Alphabet - the Words -
A Chapter - then the mighty Book -
Then - Revelation closed -
But in each Other's eyes
An Ignorance beheld -
Diviner than the Childhood's
And each to each, a Child -
Attempted to expound
What neither - understood -
Alas, that Wisdom is so large -
And Truth - so manifold!

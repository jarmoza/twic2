I play at Riches - to appease
The Clamoring for Gold -
It kept me from a Thief, I think,
For often, overbold
With Want, and Opportunity -
I could have done a Sin
And been Myself that  easy Thing
An independent Man -
But often as my lot displays
Too hungry to be borne
I deem Myself what I would be -
And novel Comforting
My Poverty and I derive -
We question if the Man -
Who own - Esteem the Opulence -
As we - Who never Can -
Should ever these exploring Hands
Chance Sovreign on a Mine -
Or in the long - uneven term
To win, become their turn -
How fitter they will be -  for Want -
Enlightening so well -
I know not which, Desire, or Grant -
Be wholly beautiful -

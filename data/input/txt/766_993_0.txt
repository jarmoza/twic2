It tossed - and tossed -
A little Brig I knew - o'ertook by Blast -
It spun - and spun -
And groped delirious, for Morn -
It slipped - and slipped -
As One that drunken - stept -
It's white foot tripped -
Then dropped from sight -
Ah, Brig - Good Night
To crew and You -
The Ocean's Heart too smooth - too Blue -
To break for You -

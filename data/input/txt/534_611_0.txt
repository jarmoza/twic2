A Murmur in the Trees - to note -
Not loud enough - for Wind -
A star - not far enough to seek -
Nor near enough - to find -
A long - long Yellow - on the Lawn -
A Hubbub - as of feet -
Not audible - as Our's - to us -
But dapperer - more sweet -
A Hurrying Home of little Men
To Houses unperceived -
All this - and more - if I should tell -
Would never be believed -
Of Robins in the Trundle bed
How many I espy
Whose Nightgowns could not hide the Wings -
Although I heard them try -
But then I promised ne'er to tell -
How could I break My word?
So go your way - and I'll go Mine -
No fear you'll miss the Road.

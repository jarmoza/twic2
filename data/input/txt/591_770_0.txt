'Twas Love - not me -
Oh punish - pray -
The Real One died for Thee -
Just Him - not me -
Such Guilt - to love Thee - most!
Doom it beyond the Rest -
Forgive it - last -
'Twas base as Jesus' - most!
Let Justice not mistake -
We Two - looked so alike -
Which was the Guilty Sake -
'Twas Love's - Now strike!

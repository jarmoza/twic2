Before the ice is in the pools -
Before the skaters go,
Or any cheek at nightfall
Is tarnished by the snow -
Before the fields have finished -
Before the Christmas tree,
Wonder opon wonder -
Will arrive to me!
What we touch the hems of
On a summer's day -
What is only walking
Just a bridge away -
That which sings so - speaks so -
When there's no one here -
Will the frock I wept in
Answer me to wear?

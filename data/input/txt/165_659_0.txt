We pray - to Heaven -
We prate - of Heaven -
Relate - when Neighbors die -
At what o'clock to Heaven - they fled -
Who saw them - Wherefore fly?
Is Heaven a Place - a Sky - a Tree?
Location's narrow way is for Ourselves -
Unto the Dead
There's no Geography -
But State - Endowal - Focus -
Where - Omnipresence - fly?

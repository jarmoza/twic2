Most she touched me by her muteness -
Most she won me by the way
She presented her small figure -
Plea itself - for Charity -
Were a Crumb my whole possession -
Were there famine in the land -
Were it my resource from starving -
Could I such a plea withstand -
Not opon her knee to thank me
Sank this Beggar from the Sky -
But the Crumb partook - departed -
And returned on High -
I supposed - when sudden
Such a Praise began
'Twas as Space sat singing
To herself - and men -
'Twas the Winged Beggar -
Afterward I learned
To her Benefactor
Making Gratitude

What shall I do - it whimpers so -
This little Hound within the Heart
All day and night with bark and start -
And yet, it will not go -
Would you untie it, were you me -
Would it stop whining - if to Thee -
I sent it - even now?
It should not teaze you -
By your chair - or, on the mat -
Or if it dare - to climb your dizzy knee -
Or - sometimes at your side to run -
When you were willing -
Shall it come?
Tell Carlo -
He' ll tell me!

Wert Thou but ill - that I might show thee
How long a Day I could endure
Though thine attention stop not on me
Nor the least signal, Me assure -
Wert Thou but stranger in ungracious country -
And Mine - the Door
Thou paused at, for a  passing bounty -
No More -
Accused - wert Thou - and Myself - Tribunal -
Convicted - sentenced - Ermine - not to Me
Half the Condition, thy Reverse - to follow -
Just to partake - the infamy -
The Tenant of the narrow Cottage, wert Thou -
Permit to be
The Housewife in thy low attendance
Contenteth Me -
No Service hast Thou, I would not achieve it -
To die - or live -
The first - Sweet, proved I, ere I saw thee -
For Life - be Love -

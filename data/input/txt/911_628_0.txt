This was a Poet -
It is That
Distills amazing sense
From Ordinary Meanings -
And Attar so immense
From the familiar species
That perished by the Door -
We wonder it was not Ourselves
Arrested it - before -
Of Pictures, the Discloser -
The Poet - it is He -
Entitles Us - by Contrast -
To ceaseless Poverty -
Of Portion - so unconscious -
The Robbing - could not harm -
Himself - to Him - a Fortune -
Exterior - to Time -

Inconceivably solemn!
Things so gay
Pierce - by the very Press
Of Imagery -
Their far Parades - order on the eye
With a mute Pomp -
A pleading Pageantry -
Flags, are a brave sight -
But no true Eye
Ever went by One -
Steadily -
Music's triumphant -
But the fine Ear
Winces with delight
Are Drums too near -

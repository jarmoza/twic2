Put up my lute!
What of - my Music!
Since the sole ear I cared to charm -
Passive - as Granite - laps my music -
Sobbing - will suit - as well as psalm!
Would but the "Memnon" of the Desert -
Teach me the strain
That vanquished Him -
When He - surrendered to the Sunrise -
Maybe - that - would awaken - them!

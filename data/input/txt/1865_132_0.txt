Pigmy Seraphs - gone astray -
Velvet people from Vevay -
Belles from some lost summer day,
Bees exclusive Coterie -
Paris could not lay the fold
Belted down with Emerald!
Venice could not show a cheek
Of a tint more lustrous meek.
Never such an ambuscade
As of briar and leaf displayed
For my little damask maid.
I had rather wear her grace
Than an Earl's distinguished face -
I had rather dwell like her
Than be Duke of Exeter -
Royalty eno' for me
To subdue the Bumblebee.

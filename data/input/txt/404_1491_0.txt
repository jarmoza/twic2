The Frost of Death was on the Pane
Protect your flower said He
Like sailors fighting with a leak
We fought Mortality -
Our passive flower we held to Sea
To mountain to the Sun
But even on his scarlet shelf
To crawl the Frost begun
We pried him back
Ourselves we wedged
Himself and Her between
But easy as a narrow snake
He forked his way along -
Till all her helpless beauty bent
And then our wrath begun
We hunted him to his Ravine
We chased Him to his Den
We hated Life and hated Death
And nowhere was to go
Than Sea and Continent there is
A larger - it is Woe -

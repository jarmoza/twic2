Sleep is supposed to be
By souls of sanity -
The shutting of the eye.
Sleep is the station grand
Down wh' on either hand -
The Hosts of Witness stand!
Morn is supposed to be
By people of degree -
The breaking of the Day!
Morning has not occurred!
That shall Aurora be
East of Eternity!
One with the banner gay,
One in the red array -
That is the Break of Day!

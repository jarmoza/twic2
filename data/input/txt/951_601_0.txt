The Color of the Grave is Green -
The Outer Grave - I mean -
You would not know it from the Field -
Except it own a Stone -
To help the fond - to find it -
Too infinite asleep
To stop and tell them where it is -
But just a Daisy - deep -
The Color of the Grave is white -
The outer Grave - I mean -
You would not know it from the Drifts -
In Winter - till the Sun -
Has furrowed out the Aisles -
Then - higher than the Land
The little Dwelling Houses rise
Where Each - has left a friend -
The Color of the Grave within -
The Duplicate - I mean -
Not all the snows c'd make it white -
Not all the Summers - Green -
You've seen the Color - maybe -
Opon a Bonnet bound -
When that you met it with before -
The Ferret - Cannot find -

Death sets a Thing significant
The Eye had hurried by
Except a perished Creature
Entreat us tenderly
To ponder little workmanships
In Crayon - or in wool -
With "This was last Her fingers did" -
Industrious until -
The Thimble weighed too heavy -
The stitches stopped - themselves -
And then 'twas put among the Dust
Opon the Closet shelves -
A Book I have - a friend gave -
Whose Pencil - here and there -
Had notched the place that pleased Him -
At Rest - His fingers are -
Now - when I read - I read not -
For interrupting Tears -
Obliterate the Etchings
Too Costly for Repairs -

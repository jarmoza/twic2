The Sun kept stooping - stooping - low!
The Hills to meet him rose!
On his side, what Transaction!
On their side, what Repose!
Deeper and deeper grew the stain
Opon the window pane -
Thicker and thicker stood the feet
Until the Tyrian
Was crowded dense with Armies -
So gay - So Brigadier -
That I felt martial stirrings
Who once the Cockade wore -
Charged, from my chimney Corner -
But Nobody was there!

"Remember me" implored the Thief!
Oh Hospitality!
My Guest "Today in Paradise"
I give thee guaranty.
That Courtesy will fair remain
When the Delight is Dust
With which we cite this mightiest case
Of compensated trust.
Of all we are allowed to hope
But Affidavit stands
That this was due where most we fear
Be unexpected Friends.

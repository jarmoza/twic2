With Pinions of Disdain
The soul can farther fly
Than any feather specified
in - Ornithology -
It wafts this sordid Flesh
Beyond it's  dull - control
And during it's electric  gale -
The Body is - a soul -
instructing by  the same -
How little work it be -
To put off filaments like this
for immortality -

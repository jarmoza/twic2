Out of sight? What of that?
See the Bird - reach it!
Curve by Curve - Sweep by Sweep -
Round the Steep Air -
Danger! What is that to Her?
Better 'tis to fail - there -
Than debate - here -
Blue is Blue - the World through -
Amber - Amber - Dew - Dew -
Seek - Friend - and see -
Heaven is shy of Earth - that's all -
Bashful Heaven - thy Lovers small -
Hide - too - from thee -

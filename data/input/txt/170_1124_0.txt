I make His Crescent fill or lack -
His Nature is at Full
Or Quarter - as I signify -
His Tides - do I control -
He holds superior in the Sky
Or gropes, at my Command
Behind inferior Clouds - or round
A Mist's slow Colonnade -
But since We hold a Mutual Disc -
And front a Mutual Day -
Which is the Despot, neither knows -
Nor Whose - the Tyranny -

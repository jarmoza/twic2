Your Riches, taught me, poverty -
Myself a Millionaire -
In little wealths - as Girls could boast -
Till broad as Buenos Ayre -
You drifted your Dominions -
A different Peru -
And I esteemed all poverty -
For Life's Estate, with you -
Of Mines, I little know, myself -
But just the names - of Gems -
The Colors of the commonest -
And scarce of Diadems -
So much - that did I meet the Queen -
Her glory - I should know -
But this - must be a different wealth -
To miss it, beggars so -
I'm sure 'tis India - all day -
To those who look on you -
Without a stint - without a blame -
Might I - but be the Jew!
I'm sure it is Golconda -
Beyond my power to deem -
To have a smile for mine, each day -
How better, than a Gem!
At least, it solaces to know -
That there exists - a Gold -
Although I prove it just in time
It's distance - to behold!
It's far - far Treasure to surmise -
And estimate the Pearl -
That slipped my simple fingers through -
While just a Girl at school!

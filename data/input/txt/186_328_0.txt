Dying! Dying in the night!
Wont somebody bring the light
So I can see which way to go
Into the everlasting snow?
And "Jesus"! Where is Jesus gone?
They said that Jesus - always came -
Perhaps he does'nt know the House -
This way, Jesus, Let him pass!
Somebody run to the great gate
And see if Dollie's coming! Wait!
I hear her feet opon the stair!
Death wont hurt - now Dollie's here!

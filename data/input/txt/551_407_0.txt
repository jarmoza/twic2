The World - stands - solemner - to me -
Since I was wed - to Him -
A modesty - befits the soul
That bears another's - name -
A doubt - if it be fair - indeed -
To wear that perfect - pearl -
The Man - opon the Woman - binds -
To clasp her soul - for all -
A prayer, that it more angel - prove -
A Whiter Gift - within -
To that munificence, that chose -
So unadorned - a Queen -
A Gratitude - that such be true -
It had esteemed the Dream -
Too beautiful - for Shape to prove -
Or posture - to redeem!

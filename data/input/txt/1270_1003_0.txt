Let Us play Yesterday -
I - the Girl at School -
You - and Eternity - the untold Tale -
Easing my famine
At my Lexicon -
Logarithm - had I - for Drink -
'Twas a dry Wine -
Somewhat different - must be -
Dreams tint the Sleep -
Cunning Reds of Morning
Make the Blind - leap -
Still at the Egg-life -
Chafing the Shell -
When you troubled the Ellipse -
And the Bird fell -
Manacles be dim - they say -
To the new Free -
Liberty - commoner -
Never could - to me -
'Twas my last gratitude
When I slept - at night -
'Twas the first Miracle
Let in - with Light -
Can the Lark resume the Shell -
Easier - for the Sky -
Would'nt Bonds hurt more
Than Yesterday?
Would'nt Dungeons sorer grate
On the Man - free -
Just long enough to taste -
Then - doomed new -
God of the Manacle
As of the Free -
Take not my Liberty
Away from Me -

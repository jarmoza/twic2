Bring me the sunset in a cup -
Reckon the morning's flagons up
And say how many dew!
Tell me how far the morning leaps,
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps
Who spun the breadths of blue!
Write me how many notes there be
In the new Robin's extasy
Among astonished boughs!
How many trips the Mullet makes -
How many Cups the Bee partakes -
The Debauchee of Dews!
Also - who laid the Rainbow's piers?
Also - who leads the docile spheres
By withs of supple blue?
Whose fingers string the stalactite -
Who counts the wampum of the night
To see that none is due?
Who built this little Alban house
And shut the windows down so close
My spirit cannot see?
Who'll let me out some gala day
With implements to fly away
Passing Pomposity?

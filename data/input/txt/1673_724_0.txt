It feels a shame to be Alive -
When Men so brave - are dead -
One envies the Distinguished Dust -
Permitted - such a Head -
The Stone - that tells defending Whom
This Spartan put away
What little of Him we - possessed
In Pawn for Liberty -
The price is great - Sublimely paid -
Do we deserve - a Thing -
That lives - like Dollars - must be piled
Before we may obtain?
Are we that wait - sufficient worth -
That such Enormous Pearl
As life - dissolved be - for Us -
In Battle's - horrid Bowl?
It may be - a Renown to live -
I think the Men who die -
Those unsustained - Saviors -
Present Divinity -

I shall keep singing!
Birds will pass me
On their way to Yellower Climes -
Each - with a Robin's expectation -
I - with my Redbreast -
And my Rhymes -
Late - when I take my place in summer -
But - I shall bring a fuller tune -
Vespers - are sweeter than matins - Signor -
Morning - only the seed - of noon -

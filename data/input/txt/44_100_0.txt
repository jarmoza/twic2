Went up a year this evening!
I recollect it well!
Amid no bells nor bravoes
The bystanders will tell!
Cheerful - as to the village -
Tranquil - as to repose -
Chastened - as to the Chapel
This humble Tourist rose!
Did not talk of returning!
Alluded to no time
When, were the gales propitious -
We might look for him!
Was grateful for the Roses
In life's diverse boquet -
Talked softly of new species
To pick another day;
Beguiling thus the wonder
The wondrous nearer drew -
Hands bustled at the moorings -
The crowd respectful grew -
Ascended from our vision
To countenances new!
A Difference - A Daisy -
Is all the rest I knew!

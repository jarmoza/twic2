Not any more to be lacked -
Not any more to be known -
Denizen of Significance
For a span so worn -
Even Nature herself
Has forgot it is there -
Sedulous of her Multitudes
Notwithstanding Despair -
Of the Ones that pursued it
Suing it not to go
Some have solaced the longing
To accompany -
Some - rescinded the Wrench -
Others - Shall I say
Plated the residue of Adz
With Monotony.

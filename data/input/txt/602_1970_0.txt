It was a quiet seeming Day -
There was no harm in earth or sky -
Till with the setting sun
There strayed an accidental Red
A strolling Hue, one would have said
To westward of the Town -
But when the Earth begun to jar
And Houses vanished with a roar
And Human Nature hid
We comprehended by the Awe
As those that Dissolution saw
The Poppy in the Cloud -

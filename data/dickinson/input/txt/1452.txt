Dew - is the Freshet in the Grass -
'Tis many a tiny Mill
Turns unperceived beneath - our feet
And Artisan lies still -
We spy the Forests and the Hills
The Tents to Nature's Show
Mistake the Outside for the in
And mention what we saw.
Could Commentators on the Sign
Of Nature's Caravan
Obtain "admission" as a Child
Some Wednesday Afternoon.

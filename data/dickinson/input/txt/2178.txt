The Bible is an untold Volume
Written by unknown Men -
By the direction of hallowed Spectres -
Subjects - Bethlehem -
Genesis - Bethlehem's Ancestor -
Satan - the Brigadier -
Judas - the first Defaulter -
David - the Troubadour -
Sin - a distinguished Precipice -
But I must desist -
Boys that believe - are very lonesome -
Other Boys - are lost -

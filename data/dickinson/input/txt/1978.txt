One Joy of so much anguish
Sweet Nature has for me -
I shun it as I do Despair
Or dear iniquity -
Why Birds, a Summer morning
Before the  Quick of Day
Should stab my ravished Spirit
With Dirks of Melody
Is part of an inquiry
That will receive reply
When Flesh and Spirit sunder
In Death's immediately -

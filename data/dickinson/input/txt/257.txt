Except to Heaven - she is nought.
Except for Angels - lone -
Except to some wide-wandering Bee -
A flower superfluous - blown.
Except for winds - provincial -
Except for Butterflies
Unnoticed as a single dew
That on the Acre lies -
The smallest Housewife in the grass,
Yet take her from the lawn
And somebody has lost the face
That made Existence - Home -

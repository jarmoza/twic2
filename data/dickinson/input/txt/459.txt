To die - takes just a little while -
They say it does'nt hurt -
It's only fainter - by degrees -
And then - it's out of sight -
A darker Ribbon - for a Day -
A Crape opon the Hat -
And then the pretty sunshine comes -
And helps us to forget -
The absent - mystic - creature -
That but for love of us -
Had gone to sleep - that soundest time -
Without the weariness -

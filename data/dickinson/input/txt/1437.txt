'Twas Crisis - All the length had passed -
That dull - benumbing time
There is in Fever or Event -
And now the Chance had come -
The instant holding in it's Claw
The privilege to live
Or Warrant to report the Soul
The other side the Grave.
The Muscles grappled as with leads
That would not let the Will -
The Spirit shook the Adamant -
But could not make it feel -
The Second poised - debated - shot -
Another, had begun -
And simultaneously, a Soul
Escaped the House unseen -

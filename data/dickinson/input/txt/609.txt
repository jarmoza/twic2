If I may have it, when it's dead,
I'll be contented - so -
If just as soon as Breath is out
It shall belong to me -
Until they lock it in the Grave,
'Tis Bliss I cannot weigh -
For tho' they lock Thee in the Grave,
Myself - can own the key -
Think of it Lover! I and Thee
Permitted - face to face to be -
After a Life - a Death - we'll say -
For Death was That -
And This - is Thee -
I'll tell Thee All - how Bald it grew -
How Midnight felt, at first - to me -
How all the Clocks stopped in the World -
And Sunshine pinched me - 'Twas so cold -
Then how the Grief got sleepy - some -
As if my soul were deaf and dumb -
Just making signs - across - to Thee -
That this way - thou could'st  notice me -
I'll tell you how I tried to keep
A smile, to show you, when this Deep
All Waded - We look back for Play,
At those Old Times - in Calvary.
Forgive me, if the Grave come slow -
For Coveting to look at Thee -
Forgive me, if to stroke thy frost
Outvisions Paradise!

To interrupt His Yellow Plan
The Sun does not allow
Caprices of the Atmosphere -
And even when the Snow
Heaves Balls of Specks, like Vicious Boy
Directly in His Eye -
Does not so much as turn His Head -
Busy with Majesty -
'Tis His to stimulate the Earth -
And magnetize the Sea -
And bind Astronomy, in place,
Yet Any passing by
Would deem Ourselves - the busier
As the minutest Bee
That rides - emits a Thunder -
A Bomb - to justify -

The murmur of a Bee
A Witchcraft - yieldeth me -
If any ask me why -
'Twere easier to die -
Than tell -
The Red opon the Hill
Taketh away my will -
If anybody sneer -
Take care - for God is here -
That's all.
The Breaking of the Day
Addeth to my Degree -
If any ask me how -
Artist - who drew me so -
Must tell!

The farthest Thunder that I heard
Was nearer than the Sky
And rumbles still - though Torrid Noons
Have lain their Missiles by -
The Lightning that preceded it
Struck no one but myself
And I would not exchange the Bolt
For all the rest of Life -
Indebtedness to Oxygen
The Chemist can repay -
But not the obligation
To Electricity -
It founds the Homes
And decks the Days
And every clamor bright
Is but the gleam concomitant
Of that waylaying Light -
The Thought is quiet as a Flake -
A Crash without a sound -
That Life's reverberation
It's explanation found -

Before I got my eye put out
I liked as well to see -
As other Creatures, that have Eyes
And know no other way -
But were it told to me - today -
That I might have the sky
For mine - I tell you that my Heart
Would split, for size of me -
The meadows - mine -
The Mountains - mine -
All Forests - Stintless Stars -
As much of Noon as I could take
Between my finite eyes -
The Motions of The Dipping Birds -
The Morning's Amber Road -
For mine - to look at when I liked -
The News would strike me dead -
So safer Guess -
With just my soul opon the Window pane -
Where other Creatures put their eyes -
Incautious - of the Sun -

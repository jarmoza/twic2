A brief, but patient illness -
An hour to prepare -
And one below, this morning
Is where the angels are -
It was a short procession -
The Bobolink was there -
An aged Bee addressed us -
And then we knelt in prayer -
We trust that she was willing -
We ask that we may be -
Summer - Sister - Seraph!
Let us go with thee!

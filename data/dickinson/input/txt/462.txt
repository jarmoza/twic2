She sweeps with many-colored Brooms -
And leaves the shreds behind -
Oh Housewife in the Evening West -
Come back - and - dust the Pond!
You dropped a Purple Ravelling in -
You dropped an Amber thread -
And now you've littered all the East
With Duds of Emerald!
And still, she plies her spotted Brooms -
And still the Aprons fly,
Till Brooms fade softly into stars -
And then I come away -

To hear an Oriole sing
May be a common thing -
Or only a divine.
It is not of the Bird
Who sings the same, unheard,
As unto Crowd -
The Fashion of the Ear
Attireth that it hear
In Dun, or fair -
So whether it be Rune -
Or whether it be none
Is of within.
The "Tune is in the Tree -"
The Skeptic - showeth me -
"No Sir! In Thee!"

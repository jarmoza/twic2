These are the Nights that Beetles love -
From Eminence remote
Drives ponderous perpendicular
His figure intimate -
The terror of the Children
The merriment of men
Depositing his Thunder
He hoists abroad again -
A Bomb opon the Ceiling
Is an improving thing -
It keeps the nerves progressive
Conjecture flourishing -
Too dear the Summer evening
Without discreet alarm -
Supplied by Entomology
With it's remaining charm

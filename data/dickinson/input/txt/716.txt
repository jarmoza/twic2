It troubled me as once I was -
For I was once a Child -
Concluding how an atom - fell -
And yet the Heavens - held -
The Heavens weighed the most - by far -
Yet Blue - and solid - stood -
Without a Bolt - that I could prove -
Would Giants - understand?
Life set me larger - problems -
Some I shall keep - to
Till Algebra is easier -
Or simpler proved - above -
Then - too - be comprehended -
What sorer - puzzled me -
Why Heaven did not break away -
And tumble - Blue - on me -

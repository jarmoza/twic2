How spacious the wind must feel morns
Encamping on a hundred dawns
Espousing one, and spurning all,
Then soaring to his temple tall!
How haughty the wind must feel noons,
Stepping to elemental tunes!
Correcting errors of the sky
Or clarifying scenery!
How lonely the wind must be nights,
When people have put out the lights,
And everything that has an inn
Closes it's shutter and goes in.

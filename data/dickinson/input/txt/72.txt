It did not surprise me -
So I said - or thought -
She will stir her pinions
And the nest forgot,
Traverse broader forests -
Build in gayer boughs,
Breathe in Ear more modern
God's old fashioned vows -
This was but a Birdling -
What and if it be
One within my bosom
Had departed me?
This was but a story -
What and if indeed
There were just such coffin
In the heart - instead?

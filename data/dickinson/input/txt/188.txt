A poor - torn Heart - a tattered heart,
That sat it down to rest -
Nor noticed that the ebbing Day
Flowed silver to the West;
Nor noticed night did soft descend,
Nor Constellation burn -
Intent opon a vision
Of Latitudes unknown -
The Angels, happening that way
This dusty heart espied -
Tenderly took it up from toil -
And carried it to God -
There - sandals for the Barefoot -
There - gathered from the gales
Do the blue Havens - by the hand
Lead the wandering sails -

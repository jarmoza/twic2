Poor little Heart!
Did they forget thee?
Then dinna care! Then dinna care!
Proud little Heart!
Did they forsake thee?
Be debonnaire! Be debonnaire!
Frail little Heart!
I would not break thee -
Could'st credit  me? Could'st credit me?
Gay little Heart -
Like Morning Glory!
Wind and Sun - wilt thee array!

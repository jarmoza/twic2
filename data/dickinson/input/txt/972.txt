A Thought went up my mind today -
That I have had before -
But did not finish - some way back -
I could not fix the Year -
Nor Where it went - nor why it came
The second time to me -
Nor definitely, what it was -
Have I the Art to say -
But somewhere - in my soul - I know -
I've met the Thing before -
It just reminded me - 'twas all -
And came my way no more -

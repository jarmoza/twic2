Unit, like Death, for Whom?
True, like the Tomb,
Who tells no secret
Told to Him -
The Grave is strict -
Tickets admit
Just two - the Bearer - and the Borne -
And seat - just One -
The Living - tell -
The Dying - but a syllable -
The Coy Dead - None -
No Chatter - here - No Tea -
So Babbler, and Bohea - stay there -
But Gravity - and Expectation - and Fear -
A tremor just, that all's not sure.

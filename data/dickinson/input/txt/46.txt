To lose - if One can find again -
To miss - if One shall meet -
The Burglar cannot rob - then -
The Broker cannot cheat.
So build the hillocks gaily -
Thou little spade of mine
Leaving nooks for Daisy
And for Columbine -
You and I the secret
Of the Crocus know -
Let us chant it softly -
" There is no more snow"!

A something in a summer's Day
As slow her flambeaux burn away
Which solemnizes me.
A something in a summer's noon -
A depth - an Azure - a perfume -
Transcending extasy.
And still within a summer's night
A something so transporting bright
I clap my hands to see -
Then vail my too inspecting face
Lest such a subtle - shimmering grace
Flutter too far for me -
The wizard fingers never rest -
The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes it's narrow bed -
Still rears the East her amber Flag -
Guides still the sun along the Crag
His Caravan of Red -
So looking on - the night - the morn
Conclude the wonder gay -
And I meet, coming thro' the dews
Another summer's Day!

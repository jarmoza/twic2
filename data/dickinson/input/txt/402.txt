Going - to - Her!
Happy - Letter! Tell Her -
Tell Her - the page I never wrote!
Tell Her, I only said - the Syntax -
And left the Verb and the Pronoun - out!
Tell Her just how the fingers - hurried -
Then - how they - stammered - slow - slow -
And then - you wished you had eyes - in your pages -
So you could see - what moved - them - so -
Tell Her - it was'nt a practised Writer -
You guessed -
From the way the sentence - toiled -
You could hear the Boddice - tug - behind you -
As if it held but the might of a Child!
You almost pitied - it - you - it worked so -
Tell Her - No - you may quibble - there -
For it would split Her Heart - to know it -
And then - you and I - were silenter!
Tell Her - Day - finished - before we - finished -
And the old Clock kept neighing - "Day"!
And you - got sleepy -
And begged to be ended -
What could - it hinder so - to say?
Tell Her - just how she sealed - you - Cautious!
But - if she ask "where you are hid" - until the evening -
Ah! Be bashful!
Gesture Coquette -
And shake your Head!

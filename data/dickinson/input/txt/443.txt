One Year ago - jots what?
God - spell the word! I - cant -
Was't Grace? Not that -
Was't Glory? That - will do -
Spell slower - Glory -
Such anniversary shall be -
Sometimes - not often - in Eternity -
When farther Parted, than the common Wo -
Look - feed opon each other's faces - so -
In doubtful meal, if it be possible
Their Banquet's real -
I tasted - careless - then -
I did not know the Wine
Came once a World - Did you?
Oh, had you told me so -
This Thirst would blister - easier - now -
You said it hurt you - most -
Mine - was an Acorn's Breast -
And could not know how fondness grew
In Shaggier Vest -
Perhaps - I could'nt -
But, had you looked in -
A Giant - eye to eye with you, had been -
No Acorn - then -
So - Twelve months ago -
We breathed -
Then dropped the Air -
Which bore it best?
Was this - the patientest -
Because it was a Child, you know -
And could not value - Air?
If to be "Elder" - mean most pain -
I'm old enough, today, I'm certain - then -
As old as thee - how soon?
One - Birthday more - or Ten?
Let me - choose!
Ah, Sir, None!

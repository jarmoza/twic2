Myself was formed - a Carpenter -
An unpretending time
My Plane, and I, together wrought
Before a Builder came -
To measure our attainments -
Had we the Art of Boards
Sufficiently developed - He'd hire us
At Halves -
My Tools took Human - Faces -
The Bench, where we had toiled -
Against the Man, persuaded -
We - Temples build - I said -

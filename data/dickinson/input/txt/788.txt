It was a quiet Way -
He asked if I was His -
I made no answer of the Tongue,
But answer of the Eyes -
And then he bore me high
Before this mortal noise
With swiftness as of Chariots -
And distance - as of Wheels -
The World did drop away
As Counties - from the feet
Of Him that leaneth in Balloon -
Opon an Ether Street -
The Gulf behind - was not -
The Continents - were new -
Eternity - it was - before
Eternity was due -
No Seasons were - to us -
It was not Night - nor Noon -
For Sunrise - stopped opon the Place -
And fastened it - in Dawn -

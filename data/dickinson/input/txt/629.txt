In falling Timbers buried -
There breathed a Man -
Outside - the spades - were plying -
The Lungs - within -
Could He - know - they sought Him -
Could They - know - He breathed -
Horrid Sand Partition -
Neither - could be heard -
Never slacked the Diggers -
But when spades had done -
Oh, Reward of Anguish,
It was dying - Then -
Many Things - are fruitless -
'Tis a Baffling Earth -
But there is no Gratitude
Like the Grace - of Death -

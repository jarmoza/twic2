I had not minded - Walls -
Were Universe - one Rock -
And far I heard his silver Call
The other side the Block -
I'd tunnel - till my Groove
Pushed sudden thro' to his -
Then my face take her Recompense -
The looking in his Eyes -
But 'tis a single Hair -
A filament - a law -
A Cobweb - wove in Adamant -
A Battlement - of Straw -
A limit like the Vail
Unto the Lady's face -
But every Mesh - a Citadel -
And Dragons - in the Crease -

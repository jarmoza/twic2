The Gentian has a parched Corolla -
Like Azure dried
'Tis Nature's buoyant juices
Beatified -
Without a vaunt or sheen
As casual as Rain
And as benign -
When most is past - it comes -
Nor isolate it seems -
It's Bond it's Friend -
To fill it's Fringed career
And aid an aged Year
Abundant end -
It's lot - were it forgot -
This truth endear -
Fidelity is gain
Creation o'er -

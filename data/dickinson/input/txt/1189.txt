A Coffin - is a small Domain,
Yet able to contain
A Citizen of Paradise
In it's diminished Plane -
A Grave - is a restricted Breadth -
Yet ampler than the Sun -
And all the Seas He populates -
And Lands He looks opon
To Him who on it's  small Repose
Bestows a single Friend -
Circumference without Relief -
Or Estimate - or End -

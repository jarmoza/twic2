The Night was wide, and furnished scant
With but a single Star -
That often as a Cloud it met -
Blew out itself - for fear -
The Wind pursued the little Bush -
And drove away the Leaves
November left - then clambered up
And fretted in the Eaves -
No Squirrel went abroad -
A Dog's belated feet
Like intermittent Plush, be heard
Adown the empty street -
To feel if Blinds be fast -
And closer to the fire -
Her little Rocking Chair to draw -
And shiver for the Poor -
The Housewife's gentle Task -
How pleasanter - said she
Unto the Sofa opposite -
The Sleet - than May, no Thee -

Triumph - may be of several kinds -
There's Triumph in the Room
When that Old Imperator - Death -
By Faith - be overcome -
There's Triumph of the finer mind
When Truth - affronted long -
Advance unmoved - to Her Supreme -
Her God - Her only Throng -
A Triumph - when Temptation's Bribe
Be slowly handed back -
One eye opon the Heaven renounced -
And One - opon the Rack -
Severer Triumph - by Himself
Experienced - who pass
Acquitted - from that Naked Bar -
Jehovah's Countenance -

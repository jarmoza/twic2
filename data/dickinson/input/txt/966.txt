I could bring You Jewels - had I a mind to -
But You have enough - of those -
I could bring You Odors from St Domingo -
Colors - from Vera Cruz -
Berries of the Bahamas - have I -
But this little Blaze
Flickering to itself - in the meadow -
Suits me - more than those -
Never a Fellow matched this Topaz -
And his Emerald Swing -
Dower itself - for Bobadilo -
Better - Could I bring?

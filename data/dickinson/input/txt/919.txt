Dont put up my Thread  Needle -
I'll begin to Sow
When the Birds begin to whistle -
Better stitches - so -
These were bent - my sight got crooked -
When my mind - is plain
I'll do seams - a Queen's endeavor
Would not blush to own -
Hems - too fine for Lady's tracing
To the sightless knot -
Tucks - of dainty interspersion -
Like a dotted Dot -
Leave my Needle in the furrow -
Where I put it down -
I can make the zigzag stitches
Straight - when I am strong -
Till then - dreaming I am sowing
Fetch the seam I missed -
Closer - so I - at my sleeping -
Still surmise I stitch -

The Wind begun to rock the Grass
With threatening Tunes and low -
He threw a Menace at the Earth -
A Menace at the Sky -
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees -
And started all abroad
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands
And throw away the Road.
The Wagons quickened on the Streets
The Thunder hurried slow -
The Lightning showed a Yellow Beak
And then a livid Claw -
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests -
The Cattle flung to Barns -
There came one drop of Giant Rain
And then as if the Hands
That held the Dams had parted hold
The Waters wrecked the Sky -
But overlooked my Father's House -
Just quartering a Tree -

Love - thou art high -
I cannot climb thee -
But, were it Two -
Who knows but we -
Taking turns - at the Chimborazo -
Ducal - at last - stand up by thee -
Love - thou art deep -
I cannot cross thee -
But, were there Two
Instead of One -
Rower, and Yacht - some sovreign Summer -
Who knows - but we'd reach the Sun?
Love - thou art Vailed -
A few - behold thee -
Smile - and alter - and prattle - and die -
Bliss - were an Oddity - without thee -
Nicknamed by God -
Eternity -

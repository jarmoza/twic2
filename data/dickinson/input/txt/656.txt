I was the slightest in the House -
I took the smallest Room -
At night, my little Lamp, and Book -
And one Geranium -
So stationed I could catch the mint
That never ceased to fall -
And just my Basket -
Let me think - I'm sure
That this was all -
I never spoke - unless addressed -
And then, 'twas brief and low -
I could not bear to live - aloud -
The Racket shamed me so -
And if it had not been so far -
And any one I knew
Were going - I had often thought
How noteless - I could die -

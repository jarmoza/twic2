Taken from men - this morning -
Carried by men today -
Met by the Gods with banners -
Who marshalled her away -
One little maid - from playmates -
One little mind from school -
There must be guests in Eden -
All the rooms are full -
Far - as the East from Even -
Dim - as the border star -
Courtiers quaint, in Kingdoms
Our departed are.

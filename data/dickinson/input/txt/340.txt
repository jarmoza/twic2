For this - accepted Breath -
Through it - compete with Death -
The fellow cannot touch this Crown -
By it - my title take -
Ah, what a royal sake
To my nescessity - stooped down!
No Wilderness - can be
Where this attendeth me -
No Desert Noon -
No fear of frost to come
Haunt the perennial bloom -
But Certain June!
Get Gabriel - to tell - the royal syllable -
Get saints - with new - unsteady tongue -
To say what trance below
Most like their glory show -
Fittest the Crown!

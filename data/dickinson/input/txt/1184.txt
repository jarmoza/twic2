Bereaved of all, I went abroad -
No less bereaved was I
Opon a New Peninsula -
The Grave preceded me -
Obtained my Lodgings, ere myself -
And when I sought my Bed -
The Grave it was reposed opon
The Pillow for my Head -
I waked, to find it first awake -
I rose - It followed me -
I tried to drop it in the Crowd -
To lose it in the Sea -
In Cups of artificial Drowse
To steep it's shape away -
The Grave - was finished - but the Spade
Remained in Memory -

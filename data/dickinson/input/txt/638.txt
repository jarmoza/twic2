A Prison gets to be a friend -
Between it's Ponderous face
And Our's - a Kinsmanship express -
And in it's narrow Eyes -
We come to look with  gratitude
For the appointed Beam
It deal us - stated as Our food -
And hungered for - the same -
We learn to know the Planks -
That answer to Our feet -
So miserable a sound - at first -
Nor even now - so sweet -
As plashing in the Pools -
When Memory was a Boy -
But a Demurer Circuit -
A Geometric Joy -
The Posture of the Key
That interrupt the Day
To Our Endeavor - Not so  real
The Cheek of Liberty -
As this Phantasm steel -
Whose features - Day and Night -
Are present to us - as Our Own -
And as escapeless - quite -
The narrow Round - the stint -
The slow exchange of Hope -
For something passiver - Content
Too steep for looking up -
The Liberty we knew
Avoided - like a Dream -
Too wide for any night but Heaven -
If That - indeed - redeem -

A wife - at Daybreak I shall be -
Sunrise - hast thou a flag for me?
At midnight - I am yet a maid -
How short it takes to make it Bride!
Then - Midnight - I have passed from thee
Unto the East - and Victory -
Midnight - Good night - I hear them call -
The Angels bustle in the hall -
Softly - my Future climbs the stair -
I fumble at my Childhood's prayer -
So soon to be a Child - no more -
The Vision flutters in the door -
Master - I've seen the face before -

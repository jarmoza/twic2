Some - keep the Sabbath - going to church -
I - keep it - staying at Home -
With a Bobolink - for a Chorister -
And an Orchard - for a Dome -
Some - keep the Sabbath, in Surplice -
I - just wear my wings -
And instead of tolling the bell, for church -
Our little Sexton - sings -
"God" - preaches - a noted Clergyman -
And the sermon is never long,
So - instead of getting to Heaven - at last -
I'm - going - all along!

Life - is what we make it -
Death - We do not know -
Christ's acquaintance with Him
Justify Him - though -
He - would trust no stranger -
Other - could betray -
Just His own endorsement -
That - sufficeth Me -
All the other Distance
He hath traversed first -
No new mile remaineth -
Far as Paradise -
His sure foot preceding -
Tender Pioneer -
Base must be the Coward
Dare not venture - now -

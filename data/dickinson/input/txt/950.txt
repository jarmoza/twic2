I could suffice for Him, I knew -
He - could suffice for Me -
Yet Hesitating Fractions - Both
Surveyed Infinity -
"Would I be Whole" He sudden broached -
My Syllable rebelled -
'Twas face to face with Nature - forced -
'Twas face to face with God -
Withdrew the Sun - to other Wests -
Withdrew the furthest Star
Before Decision - stooped to speech -
And then - be audibler
The Answer of the Sea unto
The Motion of the Moon -
Herself adjust Her Tides - unto -
Could I - do else - with Mine?

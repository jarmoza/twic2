It struck me - every Day -
The Lightning was as new
As if the Cloud that instant slit
And let the Fire through -
It burned Me - in the Night -
It Blistered to My Dream -
It sickened fresh opon my sight -
With every Morn that came -
I thought that Storm - was brief -
The Maddest - quickest by -
But Nature lost the Date of This -
And left it in the Sky -

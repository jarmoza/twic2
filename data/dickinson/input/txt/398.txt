Again - his voice is at the door -
I feel the old Degree -
I hear him ask the servant
For such an one - as me -
I take a  flower - as I go -
My face to justify -
He never saw me - in  this life -
I might surprise his eye!
I cross the Hall with mingled steps -
I - silent - pass the door -
I look on all this world contains -
Just his face - nothing more!
We talk in   venture  - and in toss -
A kind of plummet strain -
Each - sounding - shily -
Just - how - deep -
The other's one - had been -
We walk - I leave my Dog - at home -
A tender - thoughtful Moon
Goes with us - just a little way -
And - then - we are  alone -
Alone - if Angels are "alone" -
First time they try the  sky!
Alone - if those "vailed faces" - be -
We cannot count -
On High!
I'd give - to live that hour - again -
The purple - in my -
But He must count  -
My price for every

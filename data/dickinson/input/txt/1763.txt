While I was fearing it - it came -
But came with less of Fear
Because that fearing it so long
Had almost made it fair -
There is a fitting - a Dismay -
A fitting - a Despair -
'Tis harder knowing it is due
Than knowing it is here -
The Trying on the Utmost
The Morning it is new -
Is terribler than wearing it
A whole Existence through -

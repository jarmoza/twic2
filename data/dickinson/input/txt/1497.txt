The Merchant of the Picturesque
A Counter has and sales
But is within or negative
Precisely as the calls -
To Children he is small in price
And large in courtesy -
It suits him better than a check
Their artless currency -
Of Counterfeits he is so shy
Do one advance so near
As to behold his ample flight -

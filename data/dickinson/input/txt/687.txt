The Beggar Lad - dies early -
It's Somewhat in the Cold -
And somewhat in the Trudging feet -
And haply, in the World -
The Cruel - smiling - bowing World -
That took it's Cambric Way -
Nor heard the timid cry for "Bread -"
"Sweet Lady - Charity" -
Among Redeemed Children
If Trudging feet may stand -
The Barefoot time forgotten - so -
The Sleet - the bitter Wind -
The Childish Hands that teazed for Pence
Lifted adoring - then -
To Him whom never Ragged - Coat
Did supplicate in vain -

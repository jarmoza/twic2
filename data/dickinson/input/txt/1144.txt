It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone
Enclosed 'twas not of Rail
A Consciousness it's Acre, and
It held a Human Soul -
Entombed by whom, for what offence
If Home or Foreign born -
Had I the curiosity
'Twere not appeased of men
Till Resurrection, I must guess
Denied the small desire
A Rose opon it's Ridge to sow
Or take away a Briar -

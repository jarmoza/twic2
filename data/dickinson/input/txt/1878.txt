That sacred Closet when you sweep -
Entitled "Memory" -
Select a reverential Broom -
And do it silently -
'Twill be a Labor of surprise -
Besides Identity
Of other Interlocutors
A probability -
August the Dust of that Domain -
Unchallenged - let it lie -
You cannot supersede itself,
But it can silence you.

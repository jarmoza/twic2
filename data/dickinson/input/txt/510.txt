I'm ceded - I've stopped being Their's -
The name They dropped opon my face
With water, in the country church
Is finished using, now,
And They can put it with my Dolls,
My childhood, and the string of spools,
I've finished threading - too -
Baptized, before, without the choice,
But this time, consciously, Of Grace -
Unto supremest name -
Called to my Full - The Crescent dropped -
Existence's whole Arc, filled up,
With one - small Diadem -
My second Rank - too small the first -
Crowned - Crowing - on my Father's breast -
A half unconscious Queen
But this time - Adequate - Erect,
With Will to choose,
Or to reject,
And I choose, just a  Crown -

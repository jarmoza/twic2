There is a word
Which bears a sword
Can pierce an armed man -
It hurls it's barbed syllables
And is mute again -
But where it fell
The Saved will tell
On patriotic day,
Some epauletted Brother
Gave his breath away!
Wherever runs the breathless sun -
Wherever roams the day -
There is it's noiseless onset -
There is it's victory!
Behold the keenest marksman -
The most accomplished shot!
Time's sublimest target
Is a soul "forgot"!

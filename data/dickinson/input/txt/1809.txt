A Bee his burnished Carriage
Drove boldly to a Rose -
Combinedly alighting -
Himself - his Carriage was -
The Rose received his visit
With frank tranquility
Witholding not a Crescent
To his Cupidity -
Their Moment consummated -
Remained for him - to flee -
Remained for her - of rapture
But the humility.

All forgot for recollecting
Just a paltry One -
All forsook, for just a Stranger's
New Accompanying -
Grace of Wealth, and Grace of Station
Less accounted than
An unknown Esteem possessing -
Estimate - Who can -
Home effaced - Her faces dwindled -
Nature - altered small -
Sun - if shone - or Storm - if shattered -
Overlooked I all -
Dropped - my fate - a timid Pebble -
In thy bolder Sea -
Prove - me - Sweet - if I regret it -
Prove Myself - of Thee -

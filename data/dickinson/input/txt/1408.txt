Who occupies this House?
A Stranger I must judge
Since No one knows His Circumstance -
'Tis well the name and age
Are writ opon the Door
Or I should fear to pause
Where not so much as Honest Dog
Approach encourages -
It seems a Curious Town -
Some Houses very old,
Some - newly raised this Afternoon,
Were I compelled to build
It should not be among
Inhabitants so still
But where the Birds assemble
And Boys were possible
Before Myself was born
'Twas settled, so they say,
A Territory for the Ghosts
And Squirrels, formerly.
Until a Pioneer, as
Settlers often do
Liking the quiet of the Place
Attracted more unto -
And from a Settlement
A Capitol has grown
Distinguished for the gravity
Of every Citizen -
The Owner of this House
A Stranger He must be -
Eternity's Acquaintances
Are mostly so - to me -

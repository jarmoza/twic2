We see - Comparatively -
The Thing so towering high
We could not grasp it's segment
Unaided - Yesterday -
This Morning's finer Verdict -
Makes scarcely worth the toil -
A furrow - Our Cordillera -
Our Appenine - a knoll -
Perhaps 'tis kindly - done us -
The Anguish - and the loss -
The wrenching - for His Firmament
The Thing belonged to us -
To spare these striding spirits
Some Morning of Chagrin -
The waking in a Gnat's - embrace -
Our Giants - further on -

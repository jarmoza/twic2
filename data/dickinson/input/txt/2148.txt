His oriental heresies
Exhilirate the bee
And filling all the Earth and sky
With gay apostasy
Fatigued at last a clover low
Ensnares his jaded eye,
Sweet homestead where the butterfly
Betakes himself to die.
Intoxicated with the peace
Surpassing revelry,
He spends the evening of his days
In blissful revery,
Recounting nectars he has known
And attars that have failed,
And honeys, if his life be spared,
He hungers to attain.

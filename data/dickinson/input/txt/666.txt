He fought like those Who've nought to lose -
Bestowed Himself to Balls
As One who for a further Life
Had not a further Use -
Invited Death - with bold attempt -
But Death was Coy of Him
As Other Men, were Coy of Death.
To Him - to live - was Doom -
His Comrades, shifted like the Flakes
When Gusts reverse the Snow -
But He - was left alive Because
Of Greediness to die -

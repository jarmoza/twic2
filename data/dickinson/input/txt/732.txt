He gave away his Life -
To Us - Gigantic Sum -
A trifle - in his own esteem -
But magnified - by Fame -
Until it burst the Hearts
That fancied they could hold -
When swift it slipped it's limit -
And on the Heavens - unrolled -
'Tis Our's - to wince - and weep -
And wonder - and decay
By  Blossom's gradual process -
He chose - Maturity -
And quickening - as we sowed -
Just obviated Bud -
And when We turned to note the Growth -
Broke - perfect - from the Pod -

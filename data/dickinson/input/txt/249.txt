Dust is the only Secret.
Death, the only One
You cannot find out all about
In his "native town."
Nobody knew "his Father" -
Never was a Boy -
Had'nt any playmates,
Or "Early history" -
Industrious! Laconic!
Punctual! Sedate!
Bold as a Brigand!
Stiller than a Fleet!
Builds, like a Bird, too!
Christ robs the Nest -
Robin after Robin
Smuggled to Rest!

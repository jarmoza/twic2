No Man can compass a Despair -
As round a Goalless Road
No faster than a mile at once
The Traveller proceed -
Unconscious of the Width -
Unconscious that the Sun
Be setting on His progress -
So accurate the one
At estimating Pain -
Whose own - has just begun -
His ignorance - the Angel
That pilot Him along -

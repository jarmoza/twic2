The murmuring of Bees has ceased
But murmuring of some
Posterior, prophetic
Has simultaneous come -
The lower metres of the Year
When Nature's Laugh is done -
The Revelations of the Book
Whose Genesis was June
Appropriate Creatures to her change
The typic mother sends -
As Accent fades to interval
With separating Friends
Till what we could not  see, has come
And thoughts we will not show
More intimate with us become
Than Persons that we know -

Till Death - is narrow Loving -
The scantest Heart extant
Will hold you till your privilege
Of Finiteness - be spent -
But He whose loss procures you
Such Destitution that
Your Life too abject for itself
Thenceforward imitate -
Until - Resemblance perfect -
Yourself, for His pursuit
Delight of Nature - abdicate -
Exhibit Love - somewhat -

Despair's advantage is achieved
By suffering - Despair -
To be assisted of Reverse
One must Reverse have bore -
The Worthiness of Suffering like
The Worthiness of Death
Is ascertained by tasting -
As can no other Mouth
Of Savors - make us conscious -
As did ourselves partake -
Affliction feels impalpable
Until Ourselves are struck -

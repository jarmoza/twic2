One need not be a chamber - to be Haunted -
One need not be a House -
The Brain - has Corridors surpassing
Material Place -
Far safer of a Midnight - meeting
External Ghost -
Than an Interior - confronting -
The cooler - Host -
Far safer, through an Abbey - gallop -
The Stones a'chase -
Than moonless - One's A'self encounter -
In lonesome place -
Ourself - behind Ourself - Concealed -
Should startle - most -
Assassin - hid in Our Apartment -
Be Horror's least -
The Prudent - carries a Revolver -
He bolts the Door -
O'erlooking a Superior Spectre -
More near

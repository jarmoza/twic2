I gave Myself to Him -
And took Himself, for Pay -
The solemn contract of a Life
Was ratified, this way -
The Wealth might disappoint -
Myself a poorer prove
Than this great Purchaser suspect,
The Daily Own - of Love
Depreciate the Vision -
But till the Merchant buy -
Still Fable - in the Isles of spice -
The subtle Cargoes - lie -
At least - 'tis Mutual - Risk -
Some - found it - Mutual Gain -
Sweet Debt of Life - Each Night to owe -
Insolvent - every Noon -

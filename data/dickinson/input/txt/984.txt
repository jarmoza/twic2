On a Columnar Self -
How ample to rely
In Tumult - or Extremity -
How good the Certainty
That Lever cannot pry -
And Wedge cannot divide
Conviction - That Granitic Base -
Though none be on our side -
Suffice Us - for a Crowd -
Ourself - and Rectitude -
And that Assembly - not far off
From furthest Spirit - God -

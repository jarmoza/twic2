It makes no difference abroad -
The Seasons - fit - the same -
The Mornings blossom into Noons -
And split their Pods of Flame -
Wild flowers - kindle in the Woods -
The Brooks slam - all the Day -
No Black bird bates His Banjo -
For passing Calvary -
Auto da Fe - and Judgment -
Are nothing to the Bee -
His separation from His Rose -
To Him - sums Misery -

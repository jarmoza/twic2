She bore it till the simple veins
Traced azure on her hand -
Till pleading, round her quiet eyes
The purple Crayons stand.
Till Daffodils had come and gone
I cannot tell the sum,
And then she ceased to bear it -
And with the Saints sat down.
No more her patient figure
At twilight soft to meet -
No more her timid bonnet
Opon the village street -
But crowns instead, and courtiers -
And in the midst so fair,
Whose but her shy - immortal face
Of whom we're whispering here?

As Frost is best conceived
By force of it's Result -
Affliction is inferred
By subsequent effect -
If when the Sun reveal,
The Garden keep the Gash -
If as the Days resume
The wilted countenance
Cannot correct the crease
Or counteract the stain -
Presumption is Vitality
Was somewhere put in twain -

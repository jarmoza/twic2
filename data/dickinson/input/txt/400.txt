Civilization - spurns - the Leopard!
Was the Leopard - bold?
Deserts - never rebuked her Satin -
Ethiop - her Gold -
Tawny - her Customs -
She was Conscious -
Spotted - her Dun Gown -
This was the Leopard's nature - Signor -
Need - a keeper - frown?
Pity - the Pard - that left her Asia!
Memories - of Palm -
Cannot be stifled - with Narcotic -
Nor suppressed - with Balm -

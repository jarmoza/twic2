While "it" is alive -
Until Death - touches it -
While "it" and I - lap one - Air -
Dwell in one Blood -
Under one Firmament -
Show me Division - could split - or pare!
Faith - is like Death
Only, the longer -
Faith - is like Death
During - the Grave -
Faith - is the Fellow of the Resurrection,
Scooping up the Dust -
And chanting - Live!

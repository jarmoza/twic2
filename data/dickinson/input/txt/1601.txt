Some we see no more, Tenements of Wonder
Occupy to us though perhaps to them
Simpler are the Days than the Supposition
Their removing Manners
Leave us to presume.
That oblique Belief which we call Conjecture
Grapples with a Theme stubborn as sublime
Able as the Dust to equip it's feature
Adequate as Drums to enlist the Tomb.

To know just how He suffered - would be dear -
To know if any Human eyes were near
To whom He could entrust His wavering gaze -
Until it settled broad - on Paradise -
To know if He was patient - part content -
Was Dying as He thought - or different -
Was it a pleasant Day to die -
And did the Sunshine face His way -
What was His furthest mind - of Home - or God -
Or What the Distant say -
At News that He ceased Human Nature
Such a Day -
And Wishes - Had He any -
Just His Sigh - accented -
Had been legible - to Me -
And was He Confident until
Ill fluttered out - in Everlasting Well -
And if He spoke - What name was Best -
What last
What one broke off with
At the Drowsiest -
Was he afraid - or tranquil -
Might He know
How Conscious Consciousness - could grow -
Till Love that was - and Love too best to be -
Meet - and the Junction  be Eternity

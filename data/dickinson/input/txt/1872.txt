After all Birds have been investigated and laid aside -
Nature imparts the little Blue Bird - assured
Her conscientious Voice will soar unmoved
Above ostensible Vicissitude.
First at the March - competing with the Wind -
Her panting note exalts us - like a friend -
Last to adhere when Summer cleaves away -
Elegy of Integrity.

Whose are the little beds - I asked
Which in the valleys lie?
Some shook their heads, and others smiled -
And no one made reply.
Perhaps they did not hear - I said,
I will inquire again -
Whose are the beds - the tiny beds
So thick opon the plain?
'Tis Daisy, in the shortest -
A little further on -
Nearest the door - to wake the 1 st,
Little Leontodon.
'Tis Iris, Sir, and Aster -
Anemone, and Bell -
Bartsia, in the blanket red,
And chubby Daffodil.
Meanwhile - at many cradles
Her busy foot she plied -
Humming the quaintest lullaby
That ever rocked a child.
Hush! Epigea wakens!
The Crocus stirs her lids -
Rhodora's cheek is crimson -
She's dreaming of the woods!
Then turning from them reverent -
Their bedtime 'tis, she said -
The Bumble bees will wake them
When April woods are red.

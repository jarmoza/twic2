We talked as Girls do -
Fond, and late -
We speculated fair, on every subject, but the Grave -
Of our's, none affair -
We handled Destinies, as cool -
As we - Disposers - be -
And God, a Quiet Party
To our authority -
But fondest, dwelt opon Ourself
As we eventual - be -
When Girls, to Women, softly raised
We - occupy - Degree -
We parted with a contract
To cherish, and to write
But Heaven made both, impossible
Before another night.

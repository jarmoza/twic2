There is a Languor of the Life
More imminent than Pain -
'Tis Pain's Successor - When the Soul
Has suffered all it can -
A Drowsiness - diffuses -
A Dimness like a Fog
Envelopes Consciousness -
As Mists - obliterate a Crag.
The Surgeon - does not blanch - at pain -
His Habit - is severe -
But tell him that it ceased to feel -
The Creature lying there -
And he will tell you - Skill is late -
A Mightier than He -
Has ministered before Him -
There's no Vitality

The Bumble of a Bee -
A Witchcraft, yieldeth me.
If any ask me "Why" -
'Twere easier to die
Than tell!
The Red opon the Hill
Taketh away my will -
If anybody sneer,
Take care - for God is near -
That's all!
The Breaking of the Day -
Addeth to my Degree -
If any ask me "how" -
Artist who drew me so -
Must tell!

They leave us with the Infinite.
But He - is not a man -
His fingers are the size of fists -
His fists, the size of men -
And whom he foundeth, with his Arm
As Himmaleh, shall stand -
Gibraltar's everlasting Shoe
Poised lightly on his Hand,
So trust him, Comrade -
You for you, and I, for you and - me
Eternity is ample,
And quick enough, if true.

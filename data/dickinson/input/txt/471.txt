Read - Sweet - how others - strove -
Till we - are stouter -
What they - renounced -
Till we - are less afraid -
How many times they - bore the faithful witness -
Till we - are helped -
As if a Kingdom - cared!
Read then - of faith -
That shone above the fagot -
Clear strains of Hymn
The River could not drown -
Brave names of Men -
And Celestial Women -
Passed out - of Record
Into - Renown!

Taking up the fair Ideal,
Just to cast her down
When a fracture - we discover -
Or a splintered Crown -
Makes the Heavens portable -
And the Gods - a lie -
Doubtless - "Adam" - scowled at Eden -
For his perjury!
Cherishing - our poor Ideal -
Till in purer dress -
We behold her - glorified -
Comforts - search - like this -
Till the broken creatures -
We adored - for whole -
Stains - all washed -
Transfigured - mended -
Meet us - with a smile -

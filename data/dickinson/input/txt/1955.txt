What mystery pervades a well!
The water lives so far -
A neighbor from another world
Residing in a jar
Whose limit none have ever seen,
But just his lid of glass -
Like looking every time you please
In an abyss's face!
The grass does not appear afraid,
I often wonder he
Can stand so close and look so bold
At what is awe to me.
Related somehow they may be,
The sedge stands next the sea
Where he is floorless
And does no timidity betray -
But nature is a stranger yet;
The ones that cite her most
Have never passed her haunted house,
Nor simplified her ghost.
To pity those that know her not
Is helped by the regret
That those who know her, know her less
The nearer her they get.

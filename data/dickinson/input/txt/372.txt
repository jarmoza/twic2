A Mien to move a Queen -
Half Child - Half Heroine -
An Orleans in the eye
That puts it's manner by
For humbler Company
When none are near
Even a Tear -
It's frequent Visitor -
A Bonnet like a Duke -
And yet a Wren's Peruke
Were not so shy
Of Goer by -
And Hands - so slight,
They would elate a sprite
With merriment -
A Voice that alters - Low
And on the ear can go
Like Let of Snow -
Or shift supreme -
As tone of Realm
On Subjects Diadem -
Too small - to fear -
Too distant - to endear -
And so Men Compromise -
And just - revere -

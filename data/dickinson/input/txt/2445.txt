The reticent volcano keeps
His never slumbering plan;
Confided are his projects pink
To no precarious man.
If nature will not tell the tale
Jehovah told to her
Can human nature not proceed
Without a listener?
Admonished by her buckled lips
Let every prater be
The only secret neighbors keep
Is Immortality.

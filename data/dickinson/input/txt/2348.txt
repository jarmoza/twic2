"Red Sea," indeed! Talk not to me
Of purple Pharaoh -
I have a Navy in the West
Would pierce his Columns thro' -
Guileless, yet of such Glory fine
That all along the Line
Is it, or is it not, marine -
Is it, or not, divine -
The Eye inquires with a sigh
That Earth sh'd be so big -
What Exultation in the Woe -
What Wine in the fatigue!

The sun kept stooping - stooping - low -
The Hills to meet him - rose -
On his part - what Transaction!
On their part - what Repose!
Deeper and deeper grew the stain
Opon the window pane -
Thicker and thicker stood the feet
Until the Tyrian
Was crowded dense with Armies -
So gay - so Brigadier -
That I felt martial stirrings
Who once the Cockade wore -
Charged - from my chimney corner -
But nobody was there!

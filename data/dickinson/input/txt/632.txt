The Outer - from the Inner
Derives it's magnitude -
'Tis Duke, or Dwarf, according
As is the central mood -
The fine - unvarying Axis
That regulates the Wheel -
Though Spokes - spin - more conspicuous
And fling a dust - the while.
The Inner - paints the Outer -
The Brush without the Hand -
It's Picture publishes - precise -
As is the inner Brand -
On fine - Arterial Canvas -
A Cheek - perchance a Brow -
The Star's whole secret - in the Lake -
Eyes were not meant to know.

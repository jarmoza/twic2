Not probable - The barest Chance -
A smile too few - a word too much
And far from Heaven as the Rest -
The Soul so close on Paradise -
What if the Bird - from journey far -
Confused by Sweets - as Mortals - are -
Forget the secret of His wing
And perish - but a Bough between -
Oh, Groping feet -
Oh Phantom Queen!

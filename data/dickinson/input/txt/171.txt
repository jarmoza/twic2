As watchers hang opon the East,
As Beggars revel at a feast
By savory Fancy spread -
As brooks in deserts babble sweet
On ear too far for the delight -
Heaven beguiles the tired.
As that same watcher, when the East
Opens the lid of Amethyst
And lets the morning go -
That Beggar, when an honored Guest,
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed,
Heaven to us, if true.

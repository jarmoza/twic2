I should have been too glad, I see -
Too lifted - for the scant degree
Of Life's penurious Round -
My little Circuit would have shamed
This new Circumference - have blamed -
The homelier time behind -
I should have been too saved - I see -
Too rescued - Fear too dim to me
That I could spell the Prayer
I knew so perfect - yesterday -
That scalding one - Sabacthini -
Recited fluent - here -
Earth would have been too much - I see -
And Heaven - not enough for me -
I should have had the Joy
Without the Fear - to justify -
The Palm - without the Calvary -
So Savior - Crucify -
Defeat whets Victory - they say -
The Reefs in Old Gethsemane
Endear the shore beyond -
'Tis Beggars - Banquets best define -
'Tis Thirsting - vitalizes Wine -
Faith bleats to understand -

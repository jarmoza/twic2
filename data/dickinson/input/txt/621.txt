You'll find - it when you try to die -
The easier to let go -
For recollecting such as went -
You could not spare - you know.
And though their places somewhat filled -
As did their Marble names
With Moss - they never grew so full -
You chose the newer names -
And when this World - sets further back -
As Dying - say it does -
The former love - distincter grows -
And supersedes the fresh -
And Thought of them - so fair invites -
It looks too tawdry Grace
To stay behind - with just the Toys
We bought - to ease their place -

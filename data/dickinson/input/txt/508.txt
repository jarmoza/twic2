They leave us with the Infinite -
But He is not a man,
His Fingers are the size of Fists -
His Fists, the size of men.
And whom he foundeth with his Arm
As Himmaleh, shall stand -
Gibraltar's everlasting shoe
Poised lightly on his Hand -
So trust Him, Comrade!
You for you, and I
For you and me -
Eternity is Ample -
And quick enough,
If true -

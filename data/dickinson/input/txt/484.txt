Doubt Me! My Dim Companion!
Why, God, would be content
With but a fraction of the Life -
Poured thee, without a stint -
The whole of me - forever -
What more the Woman can,
Say quick, that I may dower thee
With last Delight I own!
It cannot be my spirit -
For that was thine, before -
I ceded all of Dust I knew -
What Opulence the more
Had I - a freckled Maiden
Whose farthest of Degree,
Was - that she might -
Some distant Heaven,
Dwell timidly - with thee
Sift her, from Brow to Barefoot!
Strain till last Surmise -
Drop, like a Tapestry, away,
Before the Fire's Eyes -
Winnow her finest fondness -
But hallow just the snow
Intact, in Everlasting flake -
Oh, Caviler, for you!

A Saucer holds a Cup
In sordid human Life
But in a Squirrel's estimate
A Saucer holds a Loaf -
A Table of a Tree
Demands the little King
And every Breeze that run along
His Dining Room do swing -
His Cutlery - he keeps
Within his Russet Lips -
To see it flashing when he dines
Do Birmingham eclipse -
Convicted - could we be
Of our Minutiae
The smallest Citizen that flies
Is heartier than we -

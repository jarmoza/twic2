We like March.
His Shoes are Purple -
He is new and high -
Makes he Mud for Dog and Peddler,
Makes he Forests dry.
Knows the Adder Tongue his coming
And presents her Spot.
Stands the Sun so close and mighty
That our Minds are hot.
News is he of all the others -
Bold it were to die
With the Blue Birds exercising
On his British Sky.

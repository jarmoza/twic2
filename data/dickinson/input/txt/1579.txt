We like March - his Shoes are Purple.
He is new and high -
Makes he Mud for Dog and Peddler -
Makes he Forests Dry -
Knows the Adders Tongue his coming
And begets her spot -
Stands the Sun so close and mighty -
That our Minds are hot.
News is he of all the others -
Bold it were to die
With the Blue Birds buccaneering
On his British sky -

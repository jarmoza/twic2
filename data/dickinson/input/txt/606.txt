You'll know it - as you know 'tis Noon -
By Glory -
As you do the Sun -
By Glory -
As you will in Heaven -
Know God the Father - and the Son.
By intuition, Mightiest Things
Assert themselves - and not by terms -
"I'm Midnight" - need the Midnight say -
"I'm Sunrise" - Need the Majesty?
Omnipotence - had not a Tongue -
His lisp - is Lightning - and the Sun -
His Conversation - with the Sea -
"How shall you know"?
Consult your Eye!

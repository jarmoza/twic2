How fits his Umber Coat
The Tailor of the Nut?
Combined without a seam
Like Raiment of a Dream -
Who spun the Auburn Cloth?
Computed how the girth?
The Chestnut aged grows
In those primeval Clothes -
We know that we are wise -
Accomplished in Surprise -
Yet by this Countryman -
This nature - how undone!

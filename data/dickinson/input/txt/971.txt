You've seen Balloons set - Hav'nt You?
So stately they ascend -
It is as Swans - discarded You,
For Duties Diamond -
Their Liquid Feet go softly out
Opon a Sea of Blonde -
They spurn the Air, as 'twere too mean
For Creatures so renowned -
Their Ribbons just beyond the eye -
They struggle - some - for Breath -
And yet the Crowd applaud, below -
They would not encore - Death -
The Gilded Creature strains - and spins -
Trips frantic in a Tree -
Tears open her imperial Veins -
And tumbles in the Sea -
The Crowd - retire with an Oath -
The Dust in Streets - go down -
And Clerks in Counting Rooms
Observe - "'Twas only a Balloon" -

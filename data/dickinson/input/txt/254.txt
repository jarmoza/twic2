A fuzzy fellow, without feet -
Yet doth exceeding run!
Of velvet, is his Countenance -
And his complexion, dun!
Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass!
Sometime, opon a bough,
From which he doth descend in plush
Opon the Passer-by!
All this in summer -
But when winds alarm the Forest Folk,
He taketh Damask Residence -
And struts in s wing silk!
Then, finer than a Lady,
Emerges in the spring!
A Feather on each shoulder!
You'd scarce recognize him!
By men, yclept Caterpillar!
By me! But who am I,
To tell the pretty secret
Of the Butterfly!

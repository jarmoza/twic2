How dare the robins sing,
When men and women hear
Who since they went to their account
Have settled with the year! -
Paid all that life had earned
In one consummate bill.
And now, what life or death can do
Is immaterial.
Insulting is the sun
To him whose mortal light
Beguiled of immortality
Bequeath him to the night.
Extinct be every hum
In deference to him
Whose garden wrestled with the dew,
At daybreak overcome!

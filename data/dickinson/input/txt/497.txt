How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand,
Until a sudden sky
Reveals the fact that One is rapt
Forever from the eye -
Members of the Invisible,
Existing, while we stare,
In Leagueless Opportunity,
O'ertakeless, as the Air -
Why did'nt we detain Them?
The Heavens with a smile,
Sweep by our disappointed Heads,
Without a syllable -

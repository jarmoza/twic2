The Sun - just touched the Morning
The Morning - Happy thing -
Supposed that He had come to dwell -
And Life would all be Spring!
She felt herself supremer -
A Raised - Etherial Thing!
Henceforth - for Her - what
Meanwhile - Her wheeling King -
Trailed - slow - along the Orchards -
His haughty - spangled Hems -
Leaving a new nescessity!
The want of Diadems!
The Morning - fluttered - staggered -
Felt feebly - for Her Crown -
Her unannointed forehead -
Henceforth - Her only One!

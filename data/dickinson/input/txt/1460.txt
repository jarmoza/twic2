My Cocoon tightens - Colors teaze -
I'm feeling for the Air -
A dim capacity for Wings
Demeans the Dress I wear -
A power of Butterfly must be -
The Aptitude to fly
Meadows of Majesty  concedes
And easy Sweeps of Sky -
So I must baffle at the Hint
And cipher at the Sign
And make much blunder, if at last
I take the clue divine -

You said that I "was Great" - one Day -
Then "Great" it be - if that please Thee -
Or Small, or any size at all -
Nay - I'm the size suit Thee -
Tall - like the Stag - would that?
Or lower - like the Wren -
Or other hights of other ones
I've seen?
Tell which - it's dull to guess -
And I must be Rhinoceros
Or Mouse
At once - for Thee -
So say - if Queen it be -
Or Page - please Thee -
I'm that - or nought -
Or other thing - if other thing there be -
With just this stipulus -
I suit Thee -

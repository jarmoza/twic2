Somewhere opon the general Earth
Itself exist Today -
The Magic passive but extant
That consecrated me -
Indifferent Seasons doubtless play
Where I for right to be -
Would pay each Atom that I am
But Immortality -
Reserving that but just to prove
Another Date of Thee -
Oh God of Width, do not for us
Curtail Eternity!

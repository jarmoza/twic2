Going to Heaven!
I dont know when!
Pray do not ask me how -
Indeed, I'm too astonished
To think of answering you -
Going to Heaven!
How dim it sounds!
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the shepherd's Arm -
Perhaps you're going too!
Who knows?
If you should get there first
Save just a little place for me
Close to the two I lost!
The smallest 'robe' will fit me
And just a bit of 'Crown',
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home!
I'm glad I dont believe it.
For it would stop my breath,
And I'd like to look a little more
At such a curious earth.
I am glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the mighty Autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground!

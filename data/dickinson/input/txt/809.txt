They called me to the Window, for
"'Twas Sunset" - Some one said -
I only saw a Sapphire Farm -
And just a Single Herd -
Of Opal Cattle - feeding far
Opon so vain a Hill -
As even while I looked - dissolved -
Nor Cattle were - nor Soil -
But in their Room - a Sea - displayed -
And Ships - of such a size
As Crew of Mountains - could afford -
And Decks - to seat the Skies -
This - too - the Showman rubbed away -
And when I looked again -
Nor Farm - nor Opal Herd - was there -
Nor Mediterranean -

'Twas awkward, but it fitted me -
An Ancient fashioned Heart -
It's only lore - it's Steadfastness -
In Change - unerudite -
It only moved as do the Suns -
For merit of Return -
Or Birds - confirmed perpetual
By Alternating Zone -
I only have it not Tonight
In it's established place -
For technicality of Death -
Omitted in the Lease -

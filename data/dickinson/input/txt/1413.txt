What did They do since I saw Them?
Were They industrious?
So many questions to put Them
Have I the Eagerness
That could I snatch Their Faces
That could Their lips reply
Not till the last was answered
Should They start for the Sky -
Not if the Just suspect Me
And offer a Reward
Would I restore my Booty
To that Bold Person, God,
Not if Their Party were waiting,
Not if to talk with Me
Were to Them now, Homesickness
After Eternity -

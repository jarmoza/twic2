Delayed till she had ceased to know -
Delayed till in it's vest of snow
Her loving bosom lay.
An hour behind the fleeting breath
Later by just an hour than Death -
Oh lagging Yesterday!
Could she have guessed that it would be -
Could but a Crier of the joy
Have climbed the distant hill! -
Had not the bliss so slow a pace
Who knows but this surrendered face
Were undefeated still?
Oh if there may remaining be
Any, forgot by Victory
In her imperial round -
Show them this meek apparreled thing
That could not stop to be a king
Doubtful if it be Crowned!

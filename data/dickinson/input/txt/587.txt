More Life - went out - when He went
Than Ordinary Breath -
Lit with a finer Phosphor -
Requiring in the Quench -
A Power of Renowned Cold,
The Climate of the Grave
A Temperature just adequate
So Anthracite, to live -
For some - an Ampler Zero -
A Frost more needle keen
Is nescessary, to reduce
The Ethiop within.
Others - extinguish easier -
A Gnat's minutest Fan
Sufficient to obliterate
A Tract of Citizen -
Whose Peat life - amply vivid -
Ignores the solemn News
That Popocatapel exists -
Or Etna's Scarlets, Choose -

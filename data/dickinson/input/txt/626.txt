It would have starved a Gnat -
To live so small as I -
And yet, I was a living child -
With Food's nescessity
Opon me - like a Claw -
I could no more remove
Than I could coax a Leech away -
Or make a Dragon - move -
Nor like the Gnat - had I -
The privilege to fly
And seek a Dinner for myself -
How mightier He - than I!
Nor like Himself - the Art
Opon the Window Pane
To gad my little Being out -
And not begin - again -

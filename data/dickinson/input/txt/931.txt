Like Eyes that looked on Wastes -
Incredulous of Ought
But Blank - and steady Wilderness -
Diversified by Night -
Just Infinites of Nought -
As far as it could see -
So looked the face I looked opon -
So looked itself - on Me -
I offered it no Help -
Because the Cause was Mine -
The Misery a Compact
As hopeless - as divine -
Neither - would be absolved -
Neither would be a Queen
Without the Other - Therefore -
We perish - tho' We reign -

The Future - never spoke -
Nor will He - like the Dumb -
Reveal by sign - a syllable
Of His Profound To Come -
But when the news be ripe -
Presents it - in the Act -
Forestalling Preparation -
Escape - or Substitute -
Indifferent to Him -
The Dower - as the Doom -
His Office - but to execute
Fate's - Telegram - to Him -

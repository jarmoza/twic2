The first Day's Night had come -
And grateful that a thing
So terrible - had been endured -
I told my Soul to sing -
She said her strings were snapt -
Her Bow - to atoms blown -
And so to mend her - gave me work
Until another Morn -
And then - a Day as huge
As Yesterdays in pairs,
Unrolled it's horror in my face -
Until it blocked my eyes -
My Brain - begun to laugh -
I mumbled - like a fool -
And tho' 'tis Years ago - that Day -
My Brain keeps giggling - still.
And Something's odd - within -
That person that I was -
And this One - do not feel the same -
Could it be Madness - this?

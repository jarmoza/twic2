In many and reportless places
We feel a Joy -
Reportless, also, but sincere as Nature
Or Deity -
It comes, without a consternation -
Dissolves - the same -
But leaves a  sumptuous Destitution -
Without a Name -
Profane it by a search - we cannot -
It has no home -
Nor we who having once inhaled it -
thereafter roam.

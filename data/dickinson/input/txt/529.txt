Those fair - fictitious People -
The Women - plucked away
From our  familiar  Lifetime -
The Men of Ivory -
Those Boys and Girls, in Canvas -
Who stay opon the Wall
In everlasting Keepsake -
Can anybody tell?
We trust - in places perfecter -
Inheriting Delight
Beyond our faint COnjecture -
Our dizzy Estimate -
Remembering ourselves, we trust -
Yet Blesseder - than we -
Through Knowing - where we only hope -
Receiving - where we - pray -
Of Expectation - also -
Anticipating us
With transport, that would be a pain
Except for Holiness -
Esteeming us - as Exile -
Themself - admitted Home -
Through gentle Miracle of Death -
The Way ourself, must come -

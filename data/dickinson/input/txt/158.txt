Success is counted sweetest
By those who ne'er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need -
Not one of all the purple Host
Who took the flag today
Can tell the definition so Clear of Victory -
As he defeated - dying -
On whose forbidden Ear
The distant strains of triumph
Burst agonized and Clear -

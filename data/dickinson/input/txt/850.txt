Did you ever stand in a Cavern's Mouth -
Widths out of the Sun -
And look - and shudder, and block your breath -
And deem to be alone
In such a place, what horror,
How Goblin it would be -
And fly, as 'twere pursuing you?
Then Loneliness - looks so -
Did you ever look in a Cannon's face -
Between whose Yellow eye -
And your's - the Judgment intervened -
The Question of "To die" -
Extemporizing in your ear
As cool as Satyr's Drums -
If you remember, and were saved
It's liker so - it seems -

They put Us far apart -
As separate as Sea
And Her unsown Peninsula -
We signified "These see" -
They took away our eyes -
They thwarted Us with Guns -
"I see Thee" Each responded straight
Through Telegraphic Signs -
With Dungeons - They devised -
But through their thickest skill -
And their opaquest Adamant -
Our Souls saw - just as well -
They summoned Us to die -
With sweet alacrity
We stood opon our stapled feet -
Condemned - but just - to see -
Permission to recant -
Permission to forget -
We turned our backs opon the Sun
For perjury of that -
Not Either - noticed Death -
Of Paradise - aware -
Each other's Face - was all the Disc
Each other's setting - saw -

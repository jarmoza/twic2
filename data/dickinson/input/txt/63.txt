Thro' lane it lay - thro' bramble -
Thro' clearing, and thro' wood -
Banditti often passed us
Opon the lonely road -
The wolf came peering curious -
The Owl looked puzzled down -
The Serpent's satin figure
Glid stealthily along -
The tempests touched our garments -
The Lightning's poinards gleamed -
Fierce from the crag above us
The hungry vulture screamed -
The satyr's fingers beckoned -
The Valley murmured "Come" -
These were the mates -
This was the road
These Children fluttered home.

The Fingers of the Light
Tapped soft opon the Town
With "I am great and cannot wait
So therefore let me in".
"You're soon", the Town replied,
"My Faces are asleep
But swear, and I will let you by
You will not wake them up".
The easy Guest complied
But once within the Town
The transport of His Countenance
Awakened Maid and Man
The Neighbor in the Pool
Opon His Hip elate
Made loud obeisance and the Gnat
Held up His Cup for Light.

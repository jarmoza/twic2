You're right - "the way is narrow" -
And "difficult the Gate" -
And "few there be" - Correct again -
That "enter in - thereat" -
' Tis Costly - So are purples!
'Tis just the price of Breath -
With but the "Discount" of  the Grave -
Termed by the Brokers - "Death"!
And after that - there's Heaven -
The Good man's - "Dividend" -
And Bad men - "go to Jail" -
I guess -

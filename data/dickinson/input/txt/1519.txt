The Wind took up the Northern Things
And piled them in the South -
Then gave the East unto the West
And opening his mouth
The Four Divisions of the Earth
Did make as to devour
While everything to corners slunk
Behind the awful power -
The Wind unto his Chamber went
And nature ventured out -
Her subjects scattered into place
Her systems ranged about
Again the smoke from Dwellings rose
The Day abroad was heard
How intimate, a Tempest past
The Transport of the Bird -

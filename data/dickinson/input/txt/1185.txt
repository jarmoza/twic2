Severer Service of myself
I hastened to demand
To fill the awful Vacuum
Your life had left behind -
I worried Nature with my Wheels
When Her's had ceased to run -
When she had put away Her Work
My own had just begun -
I strove to weary Brain and Bone -
To harass to fatigue
The glittering Retinue of nerves -
Vitality to clog
To some dull comfort Those obtain
Who put a Head away
They knew the Hair to -
And forget the color of the Day -
Affliction would not be appeased -
The Darkness braced as firm
As all my strategem had been
The Midnight to confirm -
No Drug for Consciousness - can be -
Alternative to die
Is Nature's only Pharmacy
For Being's Malady -

Bloom opon the mountain stated
Efflorescence of a sunset
Reproduced the same.
Seed had I, my purple sowing
Should address the day
Not a tropic of a twilight
Show itself away -
Who for tilling, to the mountain
Come, and disappear -
Whose, be this renown, or fading
Witness, is not here.
While I state the solemn petals
Far as north and east
Far as south and west expanding
Culminate in rest -
And the mountain to the evening
Fit his countenance
Indicating by no muscle
The experience.

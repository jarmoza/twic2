Love - is that later Thing than Death -
More previous - than Life -
Confirms it at it's entrance - And
Usurps it - of itself -
Tastes Death - the first - to hand the sting
The Second - to it's friend -
Disarms the little interval -
Deposits Him with God -
Then hovers - an inferior Guard -
Lest this Beloved Charge
Need - once in an Eternity -
A smaller than the Large -

It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon -
The Flower - distinct and Red -
I, passing, thought another Noon
Another in it's stead
Will equal glow, and thought no more
But came another Day
To find the Species disappeared -
The Same Locality -
The Sun in place - no other fraud
On Nature's perfect Sum -
Had I but lingered Yesterday -
Was my retrieveless blame -
Much Flowers of this and further Zones
Have perished in my Hands
For seeking it's Resemblance -
But unapproached it stands -
The single Flower of the Earth
That I, in passing by
Unconscious was - Great Nature's Face
Passed infinite by Me -

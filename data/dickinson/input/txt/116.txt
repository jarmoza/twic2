On such a night, or such a night,
Would anybody care
If such a little figure
Slipped quiet from it's chair,
So quiet - Oh how quiet,
That nobody might know
But that the little figure
Rocked softer - to and fro -
On such a dawn, or such a dawn -
Would anybody sigh
That such a little figure
Too sound asleep did lie
For Chanticleer to wake it -
Or stirring house below -
Or giddy bird in Orchard -
Or early task to do?
There was a little figure plump
For every little knoll,
Busy needles, and spools of thread -
And trudging feet from school -
Playmates, and holidays, and nuts -
And visions vast and small.
Strange that the feet so precious charged
Should reach so small a goal!

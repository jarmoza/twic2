You love me - you are sure -
I shall not fear mistake -
I shall not cheated wake -
Some grinning morn -
To find the Sunrise left -
And Orchards - unbereft -
And Dollie - gone!
I need not start - you're sure -
That night will never be -
When frightened - home to Thee I run -
To find the windows dark -
And no more Dollie - mark -
Quite none?
Be sure you're sure - you know -
I'll bear it better now -
If you'll just tell me so -
Than when - a little dull Balm grown -
Over this pain of mine -
You sting - again!

If I should die -
And you should live -
And time sh'd gurgle on -
And morn sh'd beam -
And noon should burn -
As it has usual done -
If Birds should build as early
And Bees as bustling go -
One might depart at option
From enterprise below!
'Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand
When we with Daisies lie -
That Commerce will continue -
And Trades as briskly fly -
It makes the parting tranquil
And keeps the soul serene -
That gentlemen so sprightly
Conduct the pleasing scene!

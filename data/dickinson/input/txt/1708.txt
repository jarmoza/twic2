Who were "the Father and the Son"
I pondered when a child -
And what had they to do with me
And when in terror told
Through Accents terrible as Death
To one that never died -
I thought, at least they are no worse
Than they have been described.
Who are "the Father and the Son"
Did I demand Today
"The Father and the Son" himself
Would doubtless answer me -
But had they had the readiness
When I desired to know,
We better Friends had been, perhaps,
Than time to be ensue -
We start - to learn that we believe
But once - entirely -
Belief, it does not fit so well
When altered frequently -
We blush - that Heaven if we behold -
Event ineffable -
We shall have shunned until ashamed
To own the Miracle -

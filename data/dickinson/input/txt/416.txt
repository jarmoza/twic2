The Love a Child can show - below -
Is but a Filament - I know -
Of that Diviner - Thing -
That faints opon the face of Noon -
And smites the Tinder in the Sun -
And hinders - Gabriel's Wing!
'Tis This - in Music - hints - and sways -
And far abroad - on Summer Days -
Distills - uncertain - pain -
'Tis This - afflicts us in the East -
And tints the Transit in the West -
With Harrowing - Iodine!
'Tis this - invites - appalls - endows -
Flits - glimmers - proves - dissolves -
Returns - suggests - convicts - enchants -
Then - flings in Paradise!

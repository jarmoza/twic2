So large my Will
The little that I may
Embarrasses
Like gentle infamy -
Affront to Him
For whom the Whole were small
Affront to me
Who know His meed of all.
Earth at the best
Is but a scanty Toy -
Bought, carried Home
To Immortality
It looks so small
We chiefly wonder then
At our Conceit
In purchasing.

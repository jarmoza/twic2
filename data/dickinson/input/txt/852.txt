The Wind - tapped like a tired Man -
And like a Host - "Come in"
I boldly answered - entered then
My Residence within
A Rapid - footless Guest -
To offer whom a Chair
Were as impossible as hand
A Sofa to the Air -
No Bone had He to bind Him -
His Speech was like the Push
Of numerous Humming Birds at once
From a superior Bush -
His Countenance - a Billow -
His Fingers, as He passed
Let go a music - as of tunes
Blown tremulous in Glass -
He visited - still flitting -
Then like a timid Man
Again, He tapped - 'twas flurriedly -
And I became alone -

It always felt to me - a wrong
To that Old Moses - done -
To let him see - the Canaan -
Without the entering -
And tho' in soberer moments -
No Moses there can be
I'm satisfied - the Romance
In point of injury -
Surpasses sharper stated -
Of Stephen - or of Paul -
For these - were only put to death -
While God's adroiter will
On Moses - seemed to fasten
With tantalizing Play
As Boy - should deal with lesser Boy -
To prove ability -
The fault - was doubtless Israel's -
Myself - had banned the Tribes -
And ushered Grand Old Moses
In Pentateuchal Robes
Opon the Broad Possession
'Twas little - He should see -
Old Man on Nebo! Late as this -
My justice bleeds - for Thee!

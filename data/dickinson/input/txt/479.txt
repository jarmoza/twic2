Of Tribulation, these are They,
Denoted by the White -
The Spangled Gowns, a lesser Rank
Of Victors - designate -
All these - did Conquer -
But the ones who overcame most times -
Wear nothing commoner than snow -
No Ornament, but Palms -
Surrender - is a sort unknown -
On this superior soil -
Defeat - an outgrown Anguish -
Remembered, as the Mile
Our panting Ancle barely passed -
When Night devoured the Road -
But we - stood whispering in the House -
And all we said - was "Saved"!

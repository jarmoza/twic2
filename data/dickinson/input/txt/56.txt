I never told the buried gold
Opon the hill that lies -
I saw the sun, his plunder done -
Crouch low to guard his prize -
He stood as near
As stood you here -
A pace had been between -
Did but a snake bisect the brake
My life had forfeit been.
That was a wondrous booty.
I hope 'twas honest gained -
Those were the fairest ingots
That ever kissed the spade.
Whether to keep the secret -
Whether to reveal -
Whether while I ponder
Kidd may sudden sail -
Could a shrewd advise me
We might e'en divide -
Should a shrewd betray me -
"Atropos" decide -

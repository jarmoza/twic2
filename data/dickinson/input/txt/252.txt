Wait till the Majesty of Death
Invests so mean a brow!
Almost a powdered Footman
Might dare to touch it now!
Wait till in Everlasting Robes
This Democrat is dressed -
Then prate about "Preferment" -
And "Station" - and the rest!
Around this quiet Courtier
Obsequious Angels wait!
Full royal is his Retinue!
Full purple is his state!
A Lord - might dare to lift the Hat
To such a modest Clay -
Since that My Lord - "the Lord of Lords"
Receives unblushingly!

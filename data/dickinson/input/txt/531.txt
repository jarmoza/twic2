Is Bliss then, such Abyss -
I must not put my foot amiss
For fear I spoil my shoe?
I'd rather suit my foot
Than save my Boot -
For yet to buy another Pair
Is possible,
At any store -
But Bliss, is sold just once.
The Patent lost
None buy it any more -
Say, Foot, decide the point!
The Lady cross, or not?
Verdict for Boot!

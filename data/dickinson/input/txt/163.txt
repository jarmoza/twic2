Where bells no more affright the morn -
Where scrabble never comes -
Where very nimble Gentlemen
Are forced to keep their rooms -
Where tired Children placid sleep
Thro' centuries of noon
This place is Bliss - this town is Heaven -
Please, Pater, pretty soon!
"Oh could we climb where Moses stood,
And view the Landscape o'er"
Not Father's bells - nor Factories -
Could scare us any more!

Like Some Old fashioned Miracle -
When Summertime is done -
Seems Summer's Recollection -
And the affairs of June -
As infinite Tradition - as
Cinderella's Bays -
Or little John - of Lincoln Green -
Or Blue Beard's Galleries
Her Bees - have an illusive Hum -
Her Blossoms - like a Dream
Elate us - till we almost weep -
So plausible - they seem -
Her Memory - like Strains - enchant -
Tho' Orchestra be dumb -
The Violin - in Baize - replaced -
And Ear, and Heaven - numb -

Better - than Music!
For I - who heard it -
I was used - to the Birds - before -
This - was different - 'Twas Translation -
Of all tunes I knew - and more -
'Twas'nt contained - like other stanza -
No one could play it - the second time -
But the Composer - perfect Mozart -
Perish with him - that keyless Rhyme!
Children - so - told how Brooks in Eden -
Bubbled a better - melody -
Quaintly infer - Eve's great surrender -
Urging the feet - that would - not - fly -
Children - matured - are wiser - mostly -
Eden - a legend - dimly told -
Eve - and the Anguish - Grandame's story -
But - I was telling a tune - I heard -
Not such a strain - the Church - baptizes -
When the last Saint - goes up the Aisles -
Not such a stanza splits the silence -
When the Redemption strikes her Bells -
Let me not spill - it's smallest cadence -
Humming - for promise - when alone -
Humming - until my faint Rehearsal -
Drop into tune - around the Throne -

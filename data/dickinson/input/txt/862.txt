The Soul's Superior instants
Occur to Her - alone -
When friend - and Earth's occasion
Have infinite withdrawn -
Or she - Herself - ascended
To too remote a Hight
For lower Recognition
Than Her Omnipotent -
This Mortal Abolition
Is seldom - but as fair
As Apparition - subject
To Autocratic Air -
Eternity's disclosure
To favorites - a few -
Of the Colossal substance
Of Immortality

The Doomed - regard the Sunrise
With different Delight -
Because - when next it burns abroad
They doubt to witness it -
The Man - to die - tomorrow -
Harks for the Meadow Bird -
Because it's Music stirs the Axe
That clamors for his head -
Joyful - to whom the Sunrise
Precedes Enamored - Day -
Joyful - for whom the Meadow Bird
Has ought but Elegy!

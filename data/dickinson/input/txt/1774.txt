How many schemes may die
In one short Afternoon
Entirely unknown
To those they most concern -
The man that was not lost
Because by accident
He varied by a Ribbon's width
From his accustomed route -
The Love that would not try
Because beside the Door
Some unsuspecting Horse was tied
Surveying his Despair

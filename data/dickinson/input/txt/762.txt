It's Coming - the postponeless Creature -
It gains the Block - and now - it gains the Door -
Chooses it's latch, from all the other fastenings -
Enters - with a "You know me - Sir"?
Simple Salute - and Certain Recognition -
Bold - were it enemy - Brief - were it friend -
Dresses each House in Crape, and Icicle -
And Carries one - out of it - to God -

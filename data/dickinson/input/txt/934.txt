The Tint I cannot take - is best -
The Color too remote
That I could show it in Bazaar -
A Guinea at a sight -
The fine - impalpable Array -
That swaggers on the eye
Like Cleopatra's Company -
Repeated - in the sky -
The Moments of Dominion
That happen on the Soul
And leave it with a Discontent
Too exquisite - to tell -
The eager look - on Landscapes -
As if they just repressed
Some secret - that was pushing
Like Chariots - in the Vest -
The Pleading of the Summer -
That other Prank - of Snow -
That Cushions Mystery with Tulle,
For fear the Squirrels - know.
Their Graspless manners - mock us -
Until the Cheated Eye
Shuts arrogantly - in the Grave -
Another way - to see -

He touched me, so I live to know
That such a day,  permitted so,
I groped opon his breast -
It was a boundless place to me
And silenced, as the awful Sea
Puts minor streams to rest.
And now, I'm different from before,
As if I breathed superior air -
Or brushed a Royal Gown -
My feet, too, that had wandered so -
My Gypsy face - transfigured now -
To tenderer Renown -
Into this Port, if I might come,
Rebecca, to Jerusalem,
Would not so ravished turn -
Nor Persian, baffled at her shrine
Lift such a Crucifixal sign
To her imperial Sun.

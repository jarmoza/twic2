'Tis true - They shut me in the Cold -
But then - Themselves were warm
And could not know the feeling 'twas -
Forget it - Lord - of Them -
Let not my Witness hinder Them
In Heavenly esteem -
No Paradise could be - Conferred
Through Their beloved Blame -
The Harm They did - was short - And since
Myself - who bore it - do -
Forgive Them - Even as Myself -
Or else - forgive not me -

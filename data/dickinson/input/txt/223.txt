A science - so the Savans say,
"Comparative Anatomy" -
By which a single bone -
Is made a secret to unfold
Of some rare tenant of the mold -
Else perished in the stone -
So to the eye prospective led,
This meekest flower of the mead
Opon a winter's day,
Stands representative in gold
Of Rose and Lily, manifold,
And countless Butterfly!

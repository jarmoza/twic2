Have any like Myself
Investigating March,
New Houses on the Hill descried -
And possibly a Church -
That were not, We are sure -
As lately as the Snow -
And are Today - if We exist -
Though how may this be so?
Have any like Myself
Conjectured Who may be
The Occupants of these Abodes -
So easy to the Sky -
'Twould seem that God should be
The nearest Neighbor to -
And Heaven - a convenient Grace
For Show, or Company?
Have any like Myself
Preserved the Charm secure
By shunning carefully the  Place
All Seasons of the Year,
Excepting March - 'Tis then
My Villages be seen -
And possibly a Steeple -
Not afterward - by Men -

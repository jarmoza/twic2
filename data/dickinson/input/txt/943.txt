I am ashamed - I hide -
What right have I - to be a Bride -
So late a Dowerless Girl -
Nowhere to hide my dazzled Face -
No one to teach me that new Grace -
Nor introduce - My soul -
Me to adorn - How - tell -
Trinket - to make Me beautiful -
Fabrics of Cashmere -
Never a Gown of Dun - more -
Raiment instead - of Pompadour -
For Me - My soul - to wear -
Fingers - to frame - my Round Hair
Oval - as Feudal Ladies wore -
Far Fashions - Fair -
Skill - to hold my Brow like an Earl -
Plead - like a Whippowil -
Prove - like a Pearl -
Then, for Character -
Fashion My Spirit quaint - white -
Quick - like a Liquor -
Gay - like Light -
Bring Me my best Pride -
No more ashamed -
No more to hide -
Meek - let it be - too proud - for Pride -
Baptized - this Day - A Bride -

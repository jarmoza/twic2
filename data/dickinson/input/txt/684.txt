The Day undressed - Herself -
Her Garter - was of Gold -
Her Petticoat - of Purple plain -
Her Dimities - as old
Exactly - as the World -
And yet the newest star -
Enrolled opon the Hemisphere
Be wrinkled - much as Her -
Too near to God - to pray -
Too near to Heaven - to fear -
The Lady - of the Occident
Retired without a care -
Her Candle so expire
The flickering be seen
On Ball of Mast in Bosporus -
And Dome - and Window Pane -

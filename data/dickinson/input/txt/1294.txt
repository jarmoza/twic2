Two Travellers perishing in Snow
The Forests as they froze
Together heard them strengthening
Each other with the words
That Heaven if Heaven, must contain
What Either left behind
And then the cheer too solemn grew
For language, and the Wind
Long steps across the features took
That Love had touched that Morn
With reverential Hyacinth -
The taleless Days went on
Till Mystery impatient drew
And those They left behind
Led absent, were procured of Heaven
As Those first furnished, said -

His Mansion in the Pool
The Frog forsakes -
He rises on a Log
And statements makes -
His Auditors two Worlds
Deducting me -
The Orator of April
Is hoarse Today -
His Mittens at his Feet
No Hand hath he -
His eloquence a Bubble
As Fame should be -
Applaud him to discover
To your chagrin
Demosthenes has vanished
In Waters Green -

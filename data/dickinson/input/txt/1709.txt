Who were "the Father and the Son"
We pondered when a child
And what had they to do with us -
And when portentous told
With Inference appalling -
By Distance fortified
We thought at least they are no worse
Than they have been described.
Who are the Father and the Son
Did we demand today -
The Father and the Son himself
Would doubtless specify
But had they the felicity
When we desired to know -
We better Friends had been, perhaps,
Than Time ensue - to be -
We start to find that we believe
But once - entirely -
Belief, it does not fit so well
When altered frequently.
We blush - that Heaven if we achieve -
Event ineffable -
We shall have shunned until ashamed
To own the Miracle -

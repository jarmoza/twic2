Bloom opon the Mountain - stated -
Blameless of a Name -
Efflorescence of a Sunset -
Reproduced - the same -
Seed, had I, my Purple Sowing
Should endow the Day -
Not a Tropic of a Twilight -
Show itself away -
Who for tilling - to the Mountain
Come, and disappear -
Whose be Her Renown, or fading,
Witness, is not here -
While I state - the Solemn Petals -
Far as North - and East,
Far as South and West - expanding -
Culminate - in Rest -
And the Mountain to the evening
Fit His Countenance -
Indicating, by no Muscle -
The Experience -

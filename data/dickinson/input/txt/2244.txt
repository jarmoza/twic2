To her derided Home
A weed of Summer came -
She did not know her station low
Nor ignominy's Name -
Bestowed a Summer long
Upon a fameless Flower -
Then swept as lightly from Disdain
As Lady from her Bower -
The Dandelion's Shield
Is valid as a Star -
The Buttercup's Escutcheon -
Sustains him anywhere -

The Props assist the House -
Until the House is Built -
And then the Props withdraw -
And adequate - Erect -
The House support itself -
And cease to recollect
The Scaffold, and the Carpenter -
Just such a Retrospect
Hath the Perfected Life -
A Past of Plank - and Nail -
And Slowness - then the Stagings drop -
Affirming it - A Soul -

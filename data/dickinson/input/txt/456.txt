You see I cannot see - your lifetime -
I must guess -
How many times it ache for me - today - Confess -
How many times for my far sake
The brave eyes film -
But I guess guessing hurts -
Mine - get so dim!
Too vague - the face -
My own - so patient - covets -
Too far - the strength -
My timidness enfolds -
Haunting the Heart -
Like her translated faces -
Teazing the want -
It - only - can suffice!

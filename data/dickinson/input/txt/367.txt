The Court is far away -
No Umpire - have I -
My Sovreign is offended -
To gain his grace - I'd die!
I'll seek his royal feet -
I'll say - Remember - King -
Thou shalt - thyself - one day - a Child -
Implore a larger - thing -
That Empire - is of Czars -
As small - they say - as I -
Grant me - that day - the royalty -
To intercede - for Thee -

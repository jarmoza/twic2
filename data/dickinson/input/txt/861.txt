The Battle fought between the Soul
And No Man - is the One
Of all the Battles prevalent -
By far the Greater One -
No News of it is had abroad -
It's Bodiless Campaign
Establishes, and terminates -
Invisible - Unknown -
Nor History - record it -
As Legions of a Night
The Sunrise scatters - These endure -
Enact - and terminate -

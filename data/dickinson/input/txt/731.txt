A Dying Tiger - moaned for Drink -
I hunted all the Sand -
I caught the Dripping of a Rock
And bore it in my Hand -
His mighty Balls - in death were thick -
But searching - I could see
A Vision on the Retina
Of Water - and of me -
'Twas not my blame - who sped too slow -
'Twas not his blame - who died
While I was reaching him -
But 'twas - the fact that He was dead -

This Consciousness that is aware
Of Neighbors and the Sun
Will be the one aware of Death
And that itself alone
Is traversing the interval
Experience between
And most profound experiment
Appointed unto Men -
How adequate unto itself
It's properties shall be
Itself unto itself and None
Shall make discovery -
Adventure most unto itself
The Soul condemned to be -
Attended by a single Hound
It's own identity.

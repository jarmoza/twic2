Some Rainbow - coming from the Fair!
Some Vision of the World Cashmere
I confidently see!
Or else a Peacock's purple train
Feather by feather - on the plain -
Fritters itself away!
The dreamy Butterflies bestir!
Lethargic pools resume the whirr
Of last year's sundered tune -
From some old Fortress on the Sun
Baronial Bees march - one by one -
In murmuring platoon!
The robins stand as thick today
As flakes of snow did, yesterday -
On fence, and roof - and twig -
The Orchis binds her feather on
For her old lover - Don the Sun -
Revisiting the Bog.
Without Commander - countless - still -
The Regiments of Wood and Hill
In bright detachments stand!
Behold! Whose multitudes are these?
The Children of whose Turbaned seas -
Or what Circassian Land!

I had some things that I called mine -
And God, that he called his -
Till recently a rival claim
Disturbed these amities.
The property, my garden,
Which having sown with care -
He claims the pretty acre -
And sends a Bailiff there.
The station of the parties
Forbids publicity,
But Justice is sublimer
Than Arms, or pedigree.
I'll institute an "Action" -
I'll vindicate the law -
Jove! Choose your counsel -
I retain "Shaw"!

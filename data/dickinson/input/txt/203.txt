A little bread, a crust - a crumb,
A little trust, a Demijohn -
Can keep the soul alive -
Not portly - mind!
But breathing - warm -
Conscious, as old Napoleon
The night before the Crown!
A modest lot, a fame petite -
A brief campaign of sting and sweet,
Is plenty! is enough!
A sailor's business is the Shore -
A soldier's - Balls!
Who asketh more
Must seek the neighboring life!

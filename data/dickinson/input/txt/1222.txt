What shall I do when the Summer troubles -
What, when the Rose is ripe -
What when the Eggs fly off in Music
From the Maple Keep?
What shall I do when the Skies a'chirrup
Drop a Tune on Me -
When the Bee hangs all Noon in the Buttercup
What will become of Me?
Oh, when the Squirrel fills His Pockets
And the Berries stare
How can I bear their jocund Faces
Thou from Here, so far?
'Twould'nt afflict a Robin -
All His Goods have Wings -
I - do not fly, so Wherefore
My Perennial Things?

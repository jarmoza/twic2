Through the strait pass of suffering,
The martyrs even trod,
Their feet opon temptation,
Their foreheads opon God:
A stately, shriven company
Convulsion playing round,
Harmless as streaks of meteor
Opon a planet's bond ;
Their faith, the everlasting troth,
Their expectation sure;
The needle to the North degree,
Wades so, through Polar air.

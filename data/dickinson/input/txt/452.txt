Kill your Balm - and it's Odors bless you -
Bare your Jessamine - to the storm -
And she will fling her maddest perfume -
Haply - your Summer night to Charm -
Stab the Bird - that built in your bosom -
Oh, could you catch her last Refrain -
Bubble! "forgive" - "Some better" - Bubble!
"Carol for Him - when I am gone"!

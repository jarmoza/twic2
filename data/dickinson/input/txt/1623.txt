The Mountains stood in Haze -
The Valleys stopped below
And went or waited as they liked
The River and the Sky.
At leisure was the Sun -
His interests of Fire
A little from remark withdrawn -
The Twilight spoke the Spire.
So soft opon the Scene
The Act of evening fell
We felt how neighborly a thing
Was the Invisible.

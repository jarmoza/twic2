I cross till I am weary
A Mountain - in my mind -
More Mountains - then a Sea -
More Seas - And then
A Desert - find -
And my Horizon blocks
With steady - drifting - Grains
Of unconjectured quantity -
As Asiatic Rains -
Nor this - defeat my Pace -
It hinder from the West
But as an Enemy's salute
One hurrying to Rest -
What merit had the Goal -
Except there intervene
Faint Doubt - and far Competitor -
To jeopardize the Gain?
At last - the Grace in sight -
I shout unto my feet -
I offer them the Whole of Heaven
The instant that we meet -
They strive - and yet delay -
They perish - Do we die -
Or is this Death's experiment -
Reversed - in Victory?

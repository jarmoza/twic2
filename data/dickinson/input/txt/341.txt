We dont cry - Tim and I -
We are far too grand -
But we bolt the door tight
To prevent a friend -
Then we hide our brave face
Deep in our hand -
Not to cry - Tim and I -
We are far too grand -
Nor to dream - he and me -
Do we condescend -
We just shut our brown eye
To see to the end -
Tim - see Cottages -
But, Oh, so high!
Then - we shake - Tim and I -
And lest I - cry -
Tim - reads a little Hymn -
And we both pray,
Please, Sir, I and Tim -
Always lost the way!
We must die - by and by -
Clergymen say -
Tim - shall - if I - do -
I - too - if he -
How shall we arrange it -
Tim - was - so - shy?
Take us simultaneous - Lord -
I - "Tim" - and - me!

Musicians wrestling Everywhere!
All day - among the crowded air
I hear the silver strife -
And waking, long before the morn
Such Transport breaks opon the Town
I think it that "new life"!
It is not Bird - it has no Nest -
Nor "Band", in Brass and scarlet drest -
Nor Tamborin - nor Man.
It is not Hymn from pulpit read -
The Morning Stars - the Treble led
On Time's first Afternoon!
Some say - it is the "Spheres" at play!
Some say - that bright majority
Of vanished Dames - and Men -
Some think it service in the place
Where we - with late - celestial face -
Please God - shall ascertain!

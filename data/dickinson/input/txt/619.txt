I - Years - had been - from Home -
And now - before the Door -
I dared not open - lest a face
I never saw before
Stare vacant into mine -
And ask my Business there -
My Business - just a Life I left -
Was such - still dwelling there?
I fumbled at my nerve -
I scanned the Windows o'er -
The Silence - like an Ocean rolled -
And broke against my Ear -
I laughed a Wooden laugh -
That I - could fear a Door -
Who Danger - and the Dead - had faced -
But never shook - before -
I fitted to the Latch - my Hand -
With trembling Care -
Lest back the Awful Door should spring -
And leave me - in the Floor -
I moved my fingers off, as cautiously as Glass -
And held my Ears - and like a Thief
Stole - gasping - from the House.

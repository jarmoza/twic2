I could not prove the Years had feet -
Yet confident they run
Am I, from symptoms that are past
And Series that are done -
I find my feet have further Goals -
I smile opon the Aims
That felt so ample - Yesterday -
Today's - have vaster claims -
I do not doubt the Self I was
Was competent to me -
But something awkward in the fit -
Proves that - outgrown - I see -

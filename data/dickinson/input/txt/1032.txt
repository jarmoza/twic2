The Birds reported from the South -
A News express to Me -
A spicy Charge, My little Posts -
But I am deaf - Today -
The Flowers - appealed - a timid Throng -
I reinforced the Door -
Go blossom to the Bees - I said -
And trouble Me - no More -
The Summer Grace, for notice strove -
Remote - Her best Array -
The Heart - to stimulate the Eye
Refused too utterly -
At length, a Mourner, like Myself,
She drew away austere -
Her frosts to ponder - then it was
I recollected Her -
She suffered Me, for I had mourned -
I offered Her no word -
My Witness - was the  Crape I bore -
Her - Witness - was Her Dead -
Thenceforward - We - together  dwelt -
She - never questioned Me -
Nor I - Herself -
Our Contract
A Wiser Sympathy

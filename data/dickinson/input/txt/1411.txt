A loss of something ever felt I -
The first that I could recollect
Bereft I was - of what I knew not
Too young that any should suspect
A Mourner walked among the children
I notwithstanding went about
As one bemoaning a Dominion
Itself the only Prince cast out -
Elder, Today, A session wiser,
And fainter, too, as Wiseness is
I find Myself still softly searching
For my Delinquent Palaces -
And a Suspicion, like a Finger
Touches my Forehead now and then
That I am looking oppositely
For the Site of the Kingdom of Heaven -

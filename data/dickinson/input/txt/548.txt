Good Morning - Midnight -
I'm coming Home -
Day - got tired of Me -
How could I - of Him?
Sunshine was a sweet place -
I liked to stay -
But Morn - did'nt want me - now -
So - Good night - Day!
I can look - cant I -
When the East is Red?
The Hills - have a way - then -
That puts the Heart - abroad -
You - are not so fair - Midnight -
I chose - Day -
But - please take a little Girl -
He turned away!

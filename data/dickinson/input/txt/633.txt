The Malay - took the Pearl -
Not - I - the Earl -
I - feared the Sea - too much
Unsanctified - to touch -
Praying that I might be
Worthy - the Destiny -
The Swarthy fellow swam -
And bore my Jewel - Home -
Home to the Hut! What lot
Had I - the Jewel - got -
Borne on a Dusky Breast -
I had not deemed a Vest
Of Amber - fit -
The Negro never knew
I - wooed it - too -
To gain, or be undone -
Alike to Him - One -

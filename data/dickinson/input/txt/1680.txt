He preached about Breadth till we knew he was narrow
The Broad are too broad to define
And of Truth until it proclaimed him a Liar
The Truth never hoisted a sign -
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
As Gold the Pyrites would shun
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
To meet so learned a man -

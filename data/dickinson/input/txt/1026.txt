You taught me Waiting with Myself -
Appointment strictly kept -
You taught Me fortitude of Fate -
This - also - I have learnt -
An Altitude of Death, that could
No bitterer debar
Than Life - had done - before it -
Yet - there is a Science more -
The Heaven you know - to understand
That you be not ashamed
Of Me - in Christ's bright Audience
Opon the further Hand -

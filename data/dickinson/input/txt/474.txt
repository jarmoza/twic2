There came a day - at Summer's full -
Entirely for me -
I thought that such were for the Saints -
Where Resurrections - be -
The Sun - as common - went abroad -
The Flowers - accustomed - blew -
As if no soul - that solstice passed -
Which maketh all things - new -
The time was scarce profaned - by speech -
The falling of a word
Was needless - as at Sacrament -
The Wardrobe - of Our Lord!
Each was to each - the sealed Church -
Permitted to commune -  this time -
Lest we too awkward show -
At supper of "the Lamb."
The hours slid fast - as hours will -
Clutched tight - by greedy hands -
So - faces on two Decks - look back -
Bound to opposing - lands.
And so when all the time had leaked -
Without external sound -
Each bound the other's Crucifix -
We gave no other Bond -
Sufficient Troth - that we shall  rise -
Deposed - at length the Grave -
To that new - Marriage -
Justified - through Calvaries - of Love!

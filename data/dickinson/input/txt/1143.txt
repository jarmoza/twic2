It was a Grave - yet bore no Stone -
Enclosed 'twas not - of Rail -
A Consciousness - it's Acre - And
It held a Human Soul -
Entombed by whom - for what offence -
If Home or foreign - born -
Had I the Curiosity -
'Twere not appeased of Man -
Till Resurrection, I must guess -
Denied the small desire
A Rose opon it's Ridge - to sow -
Or sacrificial Flower -

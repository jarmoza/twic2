I watched the moon around the house
Until opon a pane
She stopped, a traveller's privilege for rest
And there opon I turned, as at a stranger
The lady in the town doth think no incivility -
To lift her glass opon -
But never a stranger justified the curiosity like mine,
For not a foot, nor hand, nor formula had she
But like a head, a guillotine
Slid easily away -
Did independent amber
Sustain her in the sky,
Or like a stemless flower
Upheld in rolling air
By finer gravitation
Than binds philosopher -
No hunger had she, nor an inn
Her toilette to suffice
Nor avocation nor concern
For little mysteries
As puzzle us, like life and death
And afterward, or nay,
But seemed content too absolute
With shining, and the sky -
The privilege to scrutinize
Was scarce opon my eyes,
When with a silver practise
She vaulted out of gaze,
And next, I met her on a cloud
Myself too far below,
To follow her superior pace
Or it's advantage blue

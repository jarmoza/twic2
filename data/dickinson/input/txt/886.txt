No Rack can torture me -
My Soul - at Liberty -
Behind this mortal Bone
There knits a bolder One -
You cannot prick with Saw -
Nor pierce with Cimitar -
Two Bodies - therefore be -
Bind One - The Other fly -
The Eagle of his Nest
No easier divest -
And gain the Sky
Than mayest Thou -
Except Thyself may be
Thine Enemy -
Captivity is Consciousness -
So's Liberty -

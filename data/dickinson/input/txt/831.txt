You'll know Her - by Her Foot -
The smallest Gamboge Hand
With Fingers - where the Toes should be -
Would more affront the sand -
Than this Quaint Creature's Boot -
Adjusted by a stem -
Without a Button - I c'd vouch -
Unto a Velvet Limb -
You'll know Her - by Her Vest -
Tight fitting - Orange - Brown -
Inside a Jacket duller -
She wore when she was born -
Her Cap is small - and snug -
Constructed for the Winds -
She'd pass for Barehead - short way off -
But as she closer stands -
So finer 'tis than Wool -
You cannot feel the seam -
Nor is it clasped unto of Band -
Nor held opon - of Brim -
You'll know Her - by Her Voice -
At first - a doubtful Tone -
A sweet endeavor - but as March
To April - hurries on -
She squanders on your Head
Such Threnodies of Pearl -
You beg the Robin in your Brain
To keep the other - still -

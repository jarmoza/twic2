The Loneliness One dare not sound -
And would as soon surmise
As in it's Grave go plumbing
To ascertain the size -
The Loneliness whose worst alarm
Is lest itself should see -
And perish from before itself
For just a scrutiny -
The Horror not to be surveyed -
But skirted in the Dark -
With Consciousness suspended -
And Being under Lock -
I fear me this - is Loneliness -
The Maker of the soul
It's Caverns and it's Corridors
Illuminate - or seal -

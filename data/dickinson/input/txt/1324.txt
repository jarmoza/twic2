Three Weeks passed since I had seen Her -
Some Disease had vext
'Twas with Text and Village Singing
I beheld Her next
And a Company - Our pleasure
To discourse alone
Gracious now to me as any -
Gracious unto none -
Borne without dissent of Either
To the Parish night -
Of the Separated  Parties
Which be out of sight?

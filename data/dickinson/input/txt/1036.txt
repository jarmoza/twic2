I sometimes drop it, for a Quick -
The Thought to be alive -
Anonymous Delight to know -
And madder - to conceive -
Consoles a wo so monstrous
That did it tear all Day,
Without an instant's Respite -
'Twould look too far - to Die -
Delirium - diverts the Wretch
For Whom the Scaffold neighs -
The Hammock's motion lulls the Heads
So close on Paradise -
A Reef - crawled easy from the Sea
Eats off the Brittle Line -
The Sailor does'nt know the Stroke -
Until He's past the Pain -

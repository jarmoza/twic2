God is a distant - stately Lover -
Woos, as He states us - by His Son -
Verily, a Vicarious Courtship -
"Miles", and "Priscilla," were such an One -
But, lest the Soul - like fair "Priscilla"
Choose the Envoy - and spurn the 'Groom -
Vouches, with hyperbolic archness -
"Miles", and "John Alden" were Synonyme -

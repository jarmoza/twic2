A Tongue - to tell Him I am true!
It's fee - to be of Gold -
Had Nature - in Her monstrous House
A single Ragged Child -
To earn a Mine - would run
That Interdicted Way,
And tell Him - Charge Thee speak it plain -
That so far - Truth is True?
And answer What I do -
Beginning with the Day
That Night - begun -
Nay - Midnight - 'twas -
Since Midnight - happened - say -
If once more - Pardon - Boy -
The Magnitude thou may
Enlarge my Message - If too vast
Another Lad - help Thee -
Thy Pay - in Diamonds - be -
And His - in solid Gold -
Say Rubies - if He hesitate -
My Message - must be told -
Say - last I said - was This -
That when the Hills - come down -
And hold no higher than the Plain -
My Bond - have just begun -
And when the Heavens - disband -
And Deity conclude -
Then - look for me - Be sure you say -
Least Figure - on the Road -

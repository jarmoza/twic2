'Twas the old - road - through pain -
That unfrequented - One -
With many a turn - and thorn -
That stops - at Heaven -
This - was the Town - she passed -
There - where she - rested - last -
Then - stepped more fast -
The little tracks - close prest -
Then - not so swift -
Slow - slow - as feet did weary - grow -
Then - stopped - no other track!
Wait! Look! Her little Book -
The leaf - at love - turned back -
Her very Hat -
And this worn shoe just fits the track -
Herself - though - fled!
Another bed - a short one -
Women make - tonight -
In Chambers bright -
Too out of sight - though -
For our hoarse Good Night -
To touch her Head!

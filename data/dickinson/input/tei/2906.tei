                    <l>She could not find her Yes --</l>
                    <l>And then, I brake my life -- And Lo,</l>
                    <l>A Light, for her, did solemn glow,</l>
                    <l>The larger, as her face withdrew --</l>
                    <l>And could she, further, "No"?</l>

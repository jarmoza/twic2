                    <l>In Winter, in my room,</l>
                    <l>I came upon a worm,</l>
                    <l>Pink, lank, and warm.</l>
                    <l>But as he was a worm</l>
                    <l>And worms presume,</l>
                    <l>Not quite with him at home --</l>
                    <l>Secured him by a string</l>
                    <l>To something neighboring,</l>
                    <l>And went along.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>A trifle afterward</l>
                    <l>A thing occurred,</l>
                    <l>I'd not believe it if I heard --</l>
                    <l>But state with creeping blood;</l>
                    <l>A snake, with mottles rare,</l>
                    <l>Surveyed my chamber floor,</l>
                    <l>In feature as the worm before,</l>
                    <l>But ringed with power.</l>
                    <l>The very string</l>
                    <l>With which I tied him, too,</l>
                    <l>When he was mean and new,</l>
                    <l>That string was there.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I shrank -- "How fair you are!"</l>
                    <l>Propitiation's claw --</l>
                    <l>"Afraid," he hissed,</l>
                    <l>"Of me?"</l>
                    <l>"No cordiality?"</l>
                    <l>He fathomed me.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Then, to a rhythm slim</l>
                    <l>Secreted in his form,</l>
                    <l>As patterns swim,</l>
                    <l>Projected him.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>That time I flew,</l>
                    <l>Both eyes his way,</l>
                    <l>Lest he pursue --</l>
                    <l>Nor ever ceased to run,</l>
                    <l>Till, in a distant town,</l>
                    <l>Towns on from mine --</l>
                    <l>I sat me down;</l>
                    <l>This was a dream.</l>

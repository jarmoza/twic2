                    <l>I had a guinea golden;</l>
                    <l>I lost it in the sand,</l>
                    <l>And though the sum was simple,</l>
                    <l>And pounds were in the land,</l>
                    <l>Still had it such a value</l>
                    <l>Unto my frugal eye,</l>
                    <l>That when I could not find it</l>
                    <l>I sat me down to sigh.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I had a crimson robin</l>
                    <l>Who sang full many a day,</l>
                    <l>But when the woods were painted</l>
                    <l>He, too, did fly away.</l>
                    <l>Time brought me other robins, </l>
                    <l>Their ballads were the same, </l>
                    <l>Still for my missing troubadour</l>
                    <l>I kept the 'house at hame.'</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I had a star in heaven;</l>
                    <l>One Pleiad was its name,</l>
                    <l>And when I was not heeding</l>
                    <l>It wandered from the same.</l>
                    <l>And though the skies are crowded,</l>
                    <l>And all the night ashine,</l>
                    <l>I do not care about it,</l>
                    <l>Since none of them are mine.</l>

                    <l>My story has a moral:</l>
                    <l>I have a missing friend, </l>
                    <l>Pleiad its name, and robin,</l>
                    <l>And guinea in the sand, </l>
                    <l>And when this mournful ditty,</l>
                    <l>Accompanied with tear,</l>
                    <l>Shall meet the eye of traitor</l>
                    <l>In country far from here,</l>
                    <l>Grant that repentance solemn</l>
                    <l>May seize upon his mind,</l>
                    <l>And he no consolation</l>
                    <l>Beneath the sun may find.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>NOTE.  This poem may have had, like many others, a</l>
                    <l>personal origin. It is more than probable that it was</l>
                    <l>sent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty</l>
                    <l>reminder of letter-writing delinquencies.</l>

                    <l>Dear March, come in!</l>
                    <l>How glad I am!</l>
                    <l>I looked for you before.</l>
                    <l>Put down your hat </l>
                    <l>You must have walked </l>
                    <l>How out of breath you are!</l>
                    <l>Dear March, how are you?</l>
                    <l>And the rest?</l>
                    <l>Did you leave Nature well?</l>
                    <l>Oh, March, come right upstairs with me,</l>
                    <l>I have so much to tell!</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I got your letter, and the birds';</l>
                    <l>The maples never knew</l>
                    <l>That you were coming,  I declare,</l>
                    <l>How red their faces grew!</l>
                    <l>But, March, forgive me </l>
                    <l>And all those hills</l>
                    <l>You left for me to hue;</l>
                    <l>There was no purple suitable,</l>
                    <l>You took it all with you.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Who knocks? That April!</l>
                    <l>Lock the door!</l>
                    <l>I will not be pursued!</l>
                    <l>He stayed away a year, to call</l>
                    <l>When I am occupied.</l>
                    <l>But trifles look so trivial</l>
                    <l>As soon as you have come,</l>
                    <l>That blame is just as dear as praise</l>
                    <l>And praise as mere as blame.</l>

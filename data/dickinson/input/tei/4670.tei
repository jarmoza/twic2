                    <l>There's been a death in the opposite house</l>
                    <l>As lately as to-day.</l>
                    <l>I know it by the numb look</l>
                    <l>Such houses have alway.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>The neighbors rustle in and out,</l>
                    <l>The doctor drives away.</l>
                    <l>A window opens like a pod,</l>
                    <l>Abrupt, mechanically;</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Somebody flings a mattress out, </l>
                    <l>The children hurry by;</l>
                    <l>They wonder if It died on that, </l>
                    <l>I used to when a boy.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>The minister goes stiffly in</l>
                    <l>As if the house were his,</l>
                    <l>And he owned all the mourners now,</l>
                    <l>And little boys besides;</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>And then the milliner, and the man</l>
                    <l>Of the appalling trade,</l>
                    <l>To take the measure of the house.</l>
                    <l>There'll be that dark parade</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Of tassels and of coaches soon;</l>
                    <l>It's easy as a sign, </l>
                    <l>The intuition of the news</l>
                    <l>In just a country town.</l>

                    <l>If anybody's friend be dead,</l>
                    <l>It 's sharpest of the theme</l>
                    <l>The thinking how they walked alive,</l>
                    <l>At such and such a time.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Their costume, of a Sunday,</l>
                    <l>Some manner of the hair, </l>
                    <l>A prank nobody knew but them,</l>
                    <l>Lost, in the sepulchre.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>How warm they were on such a day:</l>
                    <l>You almost feel the date,</l>
                    <l>So short way off it seems; and now,</l>
                    <l>They 're centuries from that.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>How pleased they were at what you said;</l>
                    <l>You try to touch the smile,</l>
                    <l>And dip your fingers in the frost:</l>
                    <l>When was it, can you tell,</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>You asked the company to tea,</l>
                    <l>Acquaintance, just a few,</l>
                    <l>And chatted close with this grand thing</l>
                    <l>That don't remember you?</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Past bows and invitations,</l>
                    <l>Past interview, and vow,</l>
                    <l>Past what ourselves can estimate, </l>
                    <l>That makes the quick of woe!</l>

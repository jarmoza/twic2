                    <l>I had been hungry all the years;</l>
                    <l>My noon had come, to dine;</l>
                    <l>I, trembling, drew the table near,</l>
                    <l>And touched the curious wine.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>'T was this on tables I had seen,</l>
                    <l>When turning, hungry, lone,</l>
                    <l>I looked in windows, for the wealth</l>
                    <l>I could not hope to own.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I did not know the ample bread,</l>
                    <l>'T was so unlike the crumb</l>
                    <l>The birds and I had often shared</l>
                    <l>In Nature's dining-room.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>The plenty hurt me, 't was so new, </l>
                    <l>Myself felt ill and odd,</l>
                    <l>As berry of a mountain bush</l>
                    <l>Transplanted to the road.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Nor was I hungry; so I found</l>
                    <l>That hunger was a way</l>
                    <l>Of persons outside windows,</l>
                    <l>The entering takes away.</l>

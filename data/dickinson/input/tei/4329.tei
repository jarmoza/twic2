                    <l>To know just how he suffered would be dear;</l>
                    <l>To know if any human eyes were near</l>
                    <l>To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,</l>
                    <l>Until it settled firm on Paradise.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>To know if he was patient, part content,</l>
                    <l>Was dying as he thought, or different;</l>
                    <l>Was it a pleasant day to die,</l>
                    <l>And did the sunshine face his way?</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>What was his furthest mind, of home, or God,</l>
                    <l>Or what the distant say</l>
                    <l>At news that he ceased human nature</l>
                    <l>On such a day?</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>And wishes, had he any?</l>
                    <l>Just his sigh, accented,</l>
                    <l>Had been legible to me.</l>
                    <l>And was he confident until</l>
                    <l>Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>And if he spoke, what name was best,</l>
                    <l>What first,</l>
                    <l>What one broke off with</l>
                    <l>At the drowsiest?</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Was he afraid, or tranquil?</l>
                    <l>Might he know</l>
                    <l>How conscious consciousness could grow,</l>
                    <l>Till love that was, and love too blest to be,</l>
                    <l>Meet  and the junction be Eternity?</l>

                    <l>'T was just this time last year I died.</l>
                    <l>I know I heard the corn,</l>
                    <l>When I was carried by the farms, </l>
                    <l>It had the tassels on.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I thought how yellow it would look</l>
                    <l>When Richard went to mill;</l>
                    <l>And then I wanted to get out,</l>
                    <l>But something held my will.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I thought just how red apples wedged</l>
                    <l>The stubble's joints between;</l>
                    <l>And carts went stooping round the fields</l>
                    <l>To take the pumpkins in.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I wondered which would miss me least,</l>
                    <l>And when Thanksgiving came,</l>
                    <l>If father'd multiply the plates</l>
                    <l>To make an even sum.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>And if my stocking hung too high,</l>
                    <l>Would it blur the Christmas glee,</l>
                    <l>That not a Santa Claus could reach</l>
                    <l>The altitude of me?</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>But this sort grieved myself, and so</l>
                    <l>I thought how it would be</l>
                    <l>When just this time, some perfect year,</l>
                    <l>Themselves should come to me.</l>
                </lg>

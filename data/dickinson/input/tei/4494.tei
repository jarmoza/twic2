                    <l>I had no cause to be awake,</l>
                    <l>My best was gone to sleep,</l>
                    <l>And morn a new politeness took,</l>
                    <l>And failed to wake them up,</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>But called the others clear,</l>
                    <l>And passed their curtains by.</l>
                    <l>Sweet morning, when I over-sleep,</l>
                    <l>Knock, recollect, for me!</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I looked at sunrise once,</l>
                    <l>And then I looked at them,</l>
                    <l>And wishfulness in me arose</l>
                    <l>For circumstance the same.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>'T was such an ample peace,</l>
                    <l>It could not hold a sigh, </l>
                    <l>'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,</l>
                    <l>'T was sunset all the day.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>So choosing but a gown</l>
                    <l>And taking but a prayer,</l>
                    <l>The only raiment I should need,</l>
                    <l>I struggled, and was there.</l>

                    <l>I died for beauty, but was scarce</l>
                    <l>Adjusted in the tomb,</l>
                    <l>When one who died for truth was lain</l>
                    <l>In an adjoining room.</l>

                    <l>He questioned softly why I failed?</l>
                    <l>"For beauty," I replied.</l>
                    <l>"And I for truth,  the two are one;</l>
                    <l>We brethren are," he said.</l>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>And so, as kinsmen met a night,</l>
                    <l>We talked between the rooms,</l>
                    <l>Until the moss had reached our lips,</l>
                    <l>And covered up our names.</l>

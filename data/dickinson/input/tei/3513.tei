                    <l>It was a quiet way --</l>
                    <l>He asked if I was his --</l>
                    <l>I made no answer of the Tongue</l>
                    <l>But answer of the Eyes --</l>
                    <l>And then He bore me on</l>
                    <l>Before this mortal noise</l>
                    <l>With swiftness, as of Chariots</l>
                    <l>And distance, as of Wheels.</l>
                    <l>This World did drop away</l>
                    <l>As Acres from the feet</l>
                    <l>Of one that leaneth from Balloon</l>
                    <l>Upon an Ether street.</l>
                    <l>The Gulf behind was not,</l>
                    <l>The Continents were new --</l>
                    <l>Eternity it was before</l>
                    <l>Eternity was due.</l>
                    <l>No Seasons were to us --</l>
                    <l>It was not Night nor Morn --</l>
                    <l>But Sunrise stopped upon the place</l>
                    <l>And fastened it in Dawn.</l>

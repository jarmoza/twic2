                    <l>I felt a funeral in my brain,</l>
                    <l>And mourners, to and fro,</l>
                    <l>Kept treading, treading, till it seemed</l>
                    <l>That sense was breaking through.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>And when they all were seated,</l>
                    <l>A service like a drum</l>
                    <l>Kept beating, beating, till I thought</l>
                    <l>My mind was going numb.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>And then I heard them lift a box,</l>
                    <l>And creak across my soul</l>
                    <l>With those same boots of lead, again.</l>
                    <l>Then space began to toll</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>As all the heavens were a bell,</l>
                    <l>And Being but an ear,</l>
                    <l>And I and silence some strange race,</l>
                    <l>Wrecked, solitary, here.</l>
                </lg>

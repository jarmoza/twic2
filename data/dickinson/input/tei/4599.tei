                    <l>We like March, his shoes are purple,</l>
                    <l>He is new and high;</l>
                    <l>Makes he mud for dog and peddler,</l>
                    <l>Makes he forest dry;</l>
                    <l>Knows the adder's tongue his coming,</l>
                    <l>And begets her spot.</l>
                    <l>Stands the sun so close and mighty</l>
                    <l>That our minds are hot.</l>
                    <l>News is he of all the others;</l>
                    <l>Bold it were to die</l>
                    <l>With the blue-birds buccaneering</l>
                    <l>On his British sky.</l>

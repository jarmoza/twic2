                    <l>I dreaded that first robin so,</l>
                    <l>But he is mastered now,</l>
                    <l>And I 'm accustomed to him grown, </l>
                    <l>He hurts a little, though.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I thought if I could only live</l>
                    <l>Till that first shout got by,</l>
                    <l>Not all pianos in the woods</l>
                    <l>Had power to mangle me.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I dared not meet the daffodils,</l>
                    <l>For fear their yellow gown</l>
                    <l>Would pierce me with a fashion</l>
                    <l>So foreign to my own.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I wished the grass would hurry,</l>
                    <l>So when 't was time to see,</l>
                    <l>He 'd be too tall, the tallest one</l>
                    <l>Could stretch to look at me.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>I could not bear the bees should come,</l>
                    <l>I wished they 'd stay away</l>
                    <l>In those dim countries where they go:</l>
                    <l>What word had they for me?</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>They 're here, though; not a creature failed,</l>
                    <l>No blossom stayed away</l>
                    <l>In gentle deference to me,</l>
                    <l>The Queen of Calvary.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Each one salutes me as he goes,</l>
                    <l>And I my childish plumes</l>
                    <l>Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment</l>
                    <l>Of their unthinking drums.</l>

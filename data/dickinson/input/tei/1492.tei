                    <l>The frost of death was on the pane - </l>
                    <l>&quot;Protect your flower&quot; said he - </l>
                    <l>Like sailors fighting with a leak </l>
                    <l>We fought mortality - </l>
                    <l>Our passive flower we held to sea -</l>
                    <l>To mountain - to the sun.  </l>
                    <l>Yet even on his scarlet shelf </l>
                    <l>To crawl - the frost begun - </l>
                    <l>We pried him back - </l>
                    <l>Ourselves we wedged</l>
                    <l>Himself, and her between - </l>
                    <l>But easy as a narrow snake </l>
                    <l>He forked his way along - </l>
                    <l>Till all her helpless beauty bent </l>
                    <l>And then our wrath begun<app type="division"><lem><pb/></lem></app>
</l>
                    <l>We hunted him to his ravine </l>
                    <l>We chased him to his den - </l>
                    <l>We hated death and hated life </l>
                    <l>And nowhere was to go </l>

                    <l>Who were "the Father and the Son"</l>
                    <l>We pondered when a child,</l>
                    <l>And what had they to do with us --</l>
                    <l>And when portentous told</l>
                    <l>With inference appalling,</l>
                    <l>By Childhood fortified,</l>
                    <l>We thought, "at least they are no worse</l>
                    <l>Than they have been described."</l>

                    <l>Who are "the Father and the Son"</l>
                    <l>Did we demand today,</l>
                    <l>"The Father and the Son" himself</l>
                    <l>Would doubtless specify,</l>
                    <l>But had they the felicity</l>
                    <l>When we desired to know,</l>
                    <l>We better Friends had been, perhaps,</l>
                    <l>Than time ensue to be.</l>

                    <l>We start, to learn that we believe</l>
                    <l>But once, entirely --</l>
                    <l>Belief, it does not fit so well</l>
                    <l>When altered frequently.</l>
                    <l>We blush, that Heaven if we achieve,</l>
                    <l>Event ineffable --</l>
                    <l>We shall have shunned, until ashamed</l>
                    <l>To own the Miracle.</l>

                    <l>"Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him </l>
                    <l>Tell him the page I didn't write;</l>
                    <l>Tell him I only said the syntax,</l>
                    <l>And left the verb and the pronoun out.</l>
                    <l>Tell him just how the fingers hurried,</l>
                    <l>Then how they waded, slow, slow, slow;</l>
                    <l>And then you wished you had eyes in your pages,</l>
                    <l>So you could see what moved them so.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>"Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,</l>
                    <l>You guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;</l>
                    <l>You could hear the bodice tug, behind you,</l>
                    <l>As if it held but the might of a child;</l>
                    <l>You almost pitied it, you, it worked so.</l>
                    <l>Tell him  No, you may quibble there,</l>
                    <l>For it would split his heart to know it,</l>
                    <l>And then you and I were silenter.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>"Tell him night finished before we finished,</l>
                    <l>And the old clock kept neighing 'day!'</l>
                    <l>And you got sleepy and begged to be ended </l>
                    <l>What could it hinder so, to say?</l>
                    <l>Tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,</l>
                    <l>But if he ask where you are hid</l>
                    <l>Until to-morrow,  happy letter!</l>
                    <l>Gesture, coquette, and shake your head!"</l>

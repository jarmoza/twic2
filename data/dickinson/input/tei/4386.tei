                    <l>Before I got my eye put out,</l>
                    <l>I liked as well to see</l>
                    <l>As other creatures that have eyes,</l>
                    <l>And know no other way.</l>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>But were it told to me, to-day,</l>
                    <l>That I might have the sky</l>
                    <l>For mine, I tell you that my heart</l>
                    <l>Would split, for size of me.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>The meadows mine, the mountains mine, </l>
                    <l>All forests, stintless stars,</l>
                    <l>As much of noon as I could take</l>
                    <l>Between my finite eyes.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>The motions of the dipping birds,</l>
                    <l>The lightning's jointed road,</l>
                    <l>For mine to look at when I liked, </l>
                    <l>The news would strike me dead!</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>So safer, guess, with just my soul</l>
                    <l>Upon the window-pane</l>
                    <l>Where other creatures put their eyes,</l>
                    <l>Incautious of the sun.</l>

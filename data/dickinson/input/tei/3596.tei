                    <l>The Frost of Death was on the Pane --</l>
                    <l>"Secure your Flower" said he.</l>
                    <l>Like Sailors fighting with a Leak</l>
                    <l>We fought Mortality.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Our passive Flower we held to Sea --</l>
                    <l>To Mountain -- To the Sun --</l>
                    <l>Yet even on his Scarlet shelf</l>
                    <l>To crawl the Frost begun --</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>We pried him back</l>
                    <l>Ourselves we wedged</l>
                    <l>Himself and her between,</l>
                    <l>Yet easy as the narrow Snake</l>
                    <l>He forked his way along</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>Till all her helpless beauty bent</l>
                    <l>And then our wrath begun --</l>
                    <l>We hunted him to his Ravine</l>
                    <l>We chased him to his Den --</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>We hated Death and hated Life</l>
                    <l>And nowhere was to go --</l>
                    <l>Than Sea and continent there is</l>
                    <l>A larger -- it is Woe</l>

                    <l>I showed her heights she never saw --</l>
                    <l>"Would'st climb?" I said,</l>

                    <l>The rope that Nights were put across --</l>
                    <l>And now, "Would'st have me for a Guest?"</l>
                    <l>She could not find her yes --</l>
                    <l>And then, I brake my life, and Lo!</l>
                    <l>A light for her, did solemn glow,</l>
                    <l>The larger, as her face withdrew --</l>
                    <l>And could she, further, "No?"</l>
